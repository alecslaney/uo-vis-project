McCormick Wilderness has recovered from the logging era that ended in the early 1900&#39;s. Today, you&#39;ll find a mixture of northern hardwoods and lowland conifers interspersed with small patches of towering white pine, Michigan&#39;s State Tree. Straddling the divide between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, this region ranges from nearly level terrain to rocky cliffs. McCormick&#39;s water is what draws most visitors, with the Huron, Dead, Pahokee, and the Wild and Scenic Yellow Dog Rivers all have part of their headwaters within the wilderness. Many cascading waterfalls on the Yellow Dog make it unnavigable. The Yellow Dog is one of a few Eastern rivers designated &quot;Wild&quot;. Eighteen small lakes add sparkle to the landscape. Trout, pike, and bass live here, but only in small numbers due to the less-than-fertile-waters. The three mile White Lake Trail connects County Road 607 to White Deer Lake where the McCormick Estate once stood. Remnants of old, unmaintained trails can sometimes be found, but the rest of the Wilderness is fairly rugged, isolated, unspoiled, and relatively difficult to access.</p><p>McCormick Wilderness <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3834933.pdf\">Map</a></p>",

The lake is one of the highest elevation lakes around, capping 10,685 feet elevation and bordered by steep 12,000 foot peaks.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fishing in both the creek and lake offer promising catches of trout. Another noteworthy aspect of the campground is its access to the Colorado Trail.</p><p><strong>Natural Features: </strong>Aspen Campground, at 9,900 elevation, sits in a valley along Jefferson Creek at the base of Jefferson Hill. The single-loop campground is shaded by groves of aspen and mature spruce. Jefferson Lake, spanning about 182 acres, has deep, cold waters and freezes over in winter.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>The campground offers nearby access to two trails. Hiking, biking and horseback riding are excellent on the epic Colorado Trail, a 471-mile trail that stretches across Colorado from Denver to Durango. Also nearby is the West Jefferson Loop Trail, a foot path that goes up to the Continental Divide and loop for 11 miles.&nbsp;<br /><br />Rainbow, brown, mackinaw and brook trout can be found swimming in the creek and lake. No-wake boating is allowed in the lake and a boat ramp is easily accessible.</p><p><strong>Facilities: </strong>Amenities include picnic tables, vault toilets, drinking water from a hand pump and a campfire ring. Parking aprons are gravel and can fit up to two vehicles; maximum trailer length is 25 feet. &nbsp;There are 12 campsites at the campground.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is difficult to access Jefferson Lake Recreation Area during the winter months.

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>Vicksburg was founded in 1867 after prospectors from Leadville camping out in the Clear Creek Canyon lost their burros. The burros had wandered down the creek and when the miners found their pack animals, they discovered gold in the creek bed as well. In its heyday, Vicksburg had a post office, school, blacksmith, two hotels, two billiard halls, several saloons, a general store, an assay office, and a livery stable. Early miners packed in Balm of Gilead balsam poplar trees on the backs of burros and planted them to line the street. The trees still stand today and are watered by ditches leading from Vicksburg Creek into the town. The ditches were dug on either side of the street to provide a water system; wooden boxes were built in the ditches to keep food cold and provide water to fight fires. A daily stage ran from Vicksburg to Granite at a fare of 50 cents.</p><p>Located near Vicksburg but dating to the 1930s is the Crescent Moly Mine and Mining Camp. However, the Moly mine was not a gold mine but was associated with the molybdenum boom and the nearby Climax mine phenomenon. Both Vicksburg and the Crescent Moly Mine are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>A mile further down the valley Pine Creek empties into the Arkansas and evidence remains of prospecting and mining in this area as well. The Colorado Historical Society lists the Littlejohn mine camp on the north bank of Pine Creek:</p><p>Located in the Pine Creek mining district, structures in the complex include a cabin, a burro shed/bunk house, a forge, and several related outbuildings. All date from the 1880s and are constructed of hand hewn logs with A and V joints. Low pitch gabled roofs were made of logs, mud, dirt, and grass. Such intact examples of early log mining camps are rare as many were quickly abandoned or replaced with wood frame or masonry structures. Harry Littlejohn, who acquired the property in 1920 and lived and worked there until his death in 1952, is credited with maintaining the integrity of the complex.</p>",

It became one of the 8 initial units of the National Wild and Scenic River system in 1968. The Eleven Point River meanders through the picturesque Ozark hills of southern Missouri. Its course is cut in the shadows of steep bluffs, through sloping forested valleys, and low lying riparian ecosystems. Barely more than a small stream at its upper reaches near Thomasville, it gains considerable width and depth as its proceeds south-eastward. Springs pouring from dolomite bluffs or rushing up from a vast network of underground flow systems provide a continuous source of water and beauty. Alternating stretches of rapids and deep clear pools wind around moss covered boulders and shading bottomland hardwood trees.</p><p>ACCESS TO THE RIVER: There are currently eleven designated access points to the river by vehicle. Of these access points, 7 are managed to a standard that includes boat ramps and vault toilets. The remaining 4 access sites are managed to a lesser standard to encourage use by those wishing to avoid higher user densities. In addition, there are 8 float camps designated on the river to provide overnight camping for river users.</p><p>WHO CAN USE THE RIVER: The river has been designated for both motorized and non-motorized use. The motorized users must adhere to a 25 horsepower limit.</p><p>FISHING: There are opportunities aplenty for small mouth bass and pan fish. Special regulations apply. Go to <a href=\"https://www.mdc.mo.gov/\">www.mdc.mo.gov</a> for more information. Trout fishing starts at the confluence of the Greer spring branch and the river. Greer is the world&#39;s 10th biggest spring and doubles the size of the river while turning it into a cold water fishery. This is the beginning of the blue ribbon trout section which ex",

Beautiful flowers, tall shady trees, and graceful wildlife. The water flows clear and unpolluted from more than 30 major springs that feed it constantly and produce year round paddling conditions.

The rapids on the river are generally classified as Class I-II. There is a generous variety of fish in the river also, everything from crayfish to large mouth bass.

Wilderness is set aside by Congress as a natural area affected primarily by the forces of nature with little evidence of man&rsquo;s works - &ldquo;where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.&rdquo; Many outdoor enthusiasts seek out its peace and special closeness to experiencing the wonders of nature. No two individuals share the same meaning and values of the wilderness experience, but it is primitive and challenging, and recreationists must be self-reliant.</p><p>In the mid 1800&rsquo;s a Catholic priest dreamed of a place where Irish immigrants could escape the oppression of urban live in St. Louis. In this wild area of the Ozarks, Father Hogan established a settlement that would forever bear their name, Irish Wilderness. The Irish Wilderness, caught in the middle of the Civil War, became a &ldquo;no man&rsquo;s land&rdquo; and was raided by both Union and Confederate troops as well as bushwhackers. It is not certain what happened to Father Hogan&rsquo;s Irish immigrants, but after the war they were gone.</p><p>A printable <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm8_044190.pdf\">brochure</a> (5.7m pdf format) of the Wilderness is available for download.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trails: </strong>The major way of travel within the Irish Wilderness is the 18.6 mile Whites Creek Trail.

A long, narrow ridge supports the center of the Wilderness, with 1,020 feet as its highest &ldquo;vertebra.&rdquo; Thirteen miles of maintained foot and horse trails follow the Devils Backbone and four other ridges, dropping off into surrounding hollows in a forest dominated by oaks, hickories, and shortleaf pines.

Blue Spring, Amber Spring and McGarr Spring provide water to the river year-round.</p><p>Dogwood, redbud and wild azaleas give the wilderness a wild burst of color in the spring. Fall isn&rsquo;t to be outdone when the oaks, sweet gum, and sugar maple put on a show of yellow, oranges and reds.

White-tailed deer, gray squirrel, raccoon, coyote, red and gray fox, bobcat and striped skunk are some of the mammals native to the area. Wild turkey, red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, bald eagle, turkey vulture, great blue heron, pileated woodpecker and various songbirds can be seen.

In the early 1800&rsquo;s Sylvester Paddy began the first logging of the area, transporting timber from this area by river to St. Louis. Until the 1930&rsquo;s the area was homesteaded and grazed as open range. It became federally designated wilderness in 1983.</p><p>Big Paddy and Little Paddy Creeks characterize the Paddy Creek Wilderness with steep cliffs and rock outcrops along the drainages. These creeks have water in them throughout most of the year. In the Wilderness are a few old fields in drainages but the rest is forested.

This mountain, usually considered one of the easiest of Colorado&#39;s 54 Fourteeners, is an excellent climb for beginning mountaineers, but basic mountaineer rules still apply.&nbsp;The peak is named for the Union General William T. Sherman who, during the Civil War, practiced a scorched earth policy while marching to Atlanta in 1854.</p><p>Sherman, Colorado&#39;s 46th highest peak, is a fast hike for a reasonably fit person since it is possible to park as high as 12,000 feet, leaving only a couple thousand feet of elevation gain to the summit and a round-trip hike of just over five miles. Like all the Fourteeners though, Mount Sherman needs to be treated with respect. Thunderstorms brew over the Sawatch Range to the west and move in quickly. It always seems windy on Sherman&#39;s upper ridge and summit. It&#39;s necessary to get an early start, carry rain gear, and keep an eye on the weather for thunderstorms.</p><p>Keep in mind that this mountain is on a mining claim owned by the Day Mine Company in Leadville. This is located on <strong>private property </strong>and is not public land. Misuse of this trail could lead to closure.

Lush bluegrass lawns beneath towering pine and spruce, sparkling water fountains, gardens of native and cultivated flowers blooming throughout the summer enhanced the picturesque setting. In 1883, millionaire James V. Dexter, expanded Lakeside into a world-class resort, re-named the hotel Interlaken, and added 2,000 acres.</p><p>Relative luxury in a rustic mountain setting provided escape for the wealthy. Guests first journeyed by train to Granite (five miles east of Twin Lakes) where they boarded a side-seated platform wagon to the resort. A boardwalk led them from the stage stop to the hotel porch.</p><p>Culture was not forgotten at this rustic resort. Every week during the summer an orchestra came from Leadville to play in the pavilion, where oil paintings of the Civil War covered the walls. Billiard tables, inlaid with rare woods and ivory, provided another luxury. Guests could also spend their days playing cards, picnicking, horseback riding or hiking. Activites such as skating, skiing, and sleigh riding continued through the winter.

The landscape includes a nice mix of ponderosa pine, desert slopes, and weedy banks. Expect to find murky water conditions. Rainbow trout are found in the reservoir and average 12 inches although there have been reports of a high growth rate and good success by anglers with fish as large as 18 inches. Fingerlings are stocked in mid-May by ODFW. Early in the season, anglers line the bank near the concrete boat ramp and close to the rocks. The water is frequently turbid because of the growth of phytoplankton and because of bank erosion caused by surface waves, thus decreasing water transparency.</p><p><strong>A cement boat ramp is near the dam for launching your watercraft.</strong><br />&nbsp;</p>",

Three short side trails join the Black Canyon Trail. &nbsp;There have been two large wild fires in the area within the last decade encompassing most of the wilderness.</p><ul><li><strong>Elevation range:</strong> 2,850&#39; - 6,483&#39;</li><li><strong>Trail map</strong>: View a <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3829228.pdf\">Black Canyon Wilderness area trails map</a>&nbsp;(.pdf)</li><li><strong>Key access points: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ochoco/recarea/?recid=79446#black\">Trail and trailhead access information</a></li></ul><p><style type=\"text/css\">.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 80%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{p",

The peaks of East Point and North Point look across the wilderness from 6,625 feet and 6,607 feet, respectively.</p><p>The benches and springs in Bridge Creek are the result of massive landslides, heavy basalts cascading down weathered clay zones within the underlying volcanic terrain. Pisgah Lookout sits up on basalt rim, overlooking the wilderness.</p><p>The forest is mostly fir and larch with streaks of pine and clearings of sagebrush and bunchgrass. Stands of white fir and lodgepole pine are found in the central core of the wilderness. Most of the 30 inches of annual precipitation falls as winter snow. There are five perennial springs in the wilderness, including the Thompson, Pisgah, Masterson, Nelson, and Maxwell springs. Wildlife prominent in the area include elk, coyote, rabbit and many raptors and cavity nesting birds.</p><p>Orientation skills are a must for traveling because <strong>there are no maintained trails in Bridge Creek Wilderness</strong>. Off-trail hiking through the tangled understory tends to be difficult. Wind has stunted the trees and opened the country around North Point; a hike of about 1.2 miles from near Pisgah Springs along an abandoned jeep track will take you to the summit. Another abandoned trail leads about 1.5 miles to the summit of East Point.</p><p>In 2008, the Bridge Creek Fire burned most of the wilderness to stand replacement conditions. It is now more accessible with greater line-of-sight vistas. <strong>Please use caution</strong> as many trees have been weakened and present additional danger.</p><ul><li><strong>Elevation range</strong>: 5,200&#39; to 6,607&#39;</li><li><strong>Key access points:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ochoco/recarea/?recid=79447#accessbridgecreek\">Bridge Creek Wilderness access information</a></li></ul><p><style type=\"text/css\">.embed-container {position: r",

The terrain-surrounding Haystack is plain, consisting of sage and irrigated pastureland that is typical of high desert landscape. The fishing is sometimes slow but with the warmer weather and the magnificent view of Mt. Jefferson it can make the trip worthwhile. Haystack is open year round for fishing but check with the ODFW for any unusual regulations. It often freezes over in the winter, the ice is usually very thin due to the lower elevation of the lake and consequently the ice fishing is poor but with ice-out a viable fishery emerges.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Also, see the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ochoco/recreation/wateractivities/recarea/?recid=39142&amp;actid=82\">Haystack Reservoir Campground and Day Use Area</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ochoco/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=72084&amp;actid=29\">Haystack Reservoir West Shore Campground</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ochoco/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=72088&amp;actid=33\">Haystack Reservoir South Shore Group Campground</a>.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Caution</strong>: Expect lots of human activity through the summer, culminated by a drag-boat race event held annually during the third week of August.</div><div>For boat launch information see Haystack Reservoir Campground, (when water is low the ramp cannot be used) and also on the west side a boat ramp which is near the dam.</div>",

The survey crew&#39;s error in 1882, became one of Minnesota&#39;s greatest treasures. Today, less than two percent of Minnesota&#39;s forested land contains old growth timber.

Neils Logging Company.&nbsp; In 1926, the Forest Service purchased the dam under Public Law 270.&nbsp; The dam was rebuilt in 1928 and reconstructed in 1964.&nbsp; It was the second in a series of eight dams on the Mississippi Headwaters lakes.&nbsp; Ottertail Power Company owns the dam upstream that controls the water level of Lake Bemidji.&nbsp; Six dams downstream are operated by the US Army Corps of Engineers (COE).&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, the Chippewa National Forest successfully implemented the Knutson Dam Improvement Project. The project removed the failing Knutson Dam and reconnected the Mississippi River at the outlet of Cass Lake through construction of an innovative rock arch rapids.&nbsp; The project restored spawning habitat for a variety of warm water species such as walleye and white sucker.&nbsp; It enhanced aquatic organism passage to over 30 miles of river and more than 72,000 acres of lakes such as Cass Lake and Lake Winnibigoshish, which are world-class walleye fisheries.&nbsp; The project also improved recreational fishing access through the addition of a modern fishing pier, reduced the potential for lakeshore erosion on Cass Lake, and reduced the safety hazard of the former logging dam.</p>",

Heir to the Joyce Family fortune originating in part from lumber taken from northern Minnesota via the Itasca Lumber Company, David Joyce of Chicago built the estate from 1917-1935. Due to excellent railway connections from Minneapolis and Chicago, and its scenic beauty, the Grand Rapids area became nationally known as a major resort area. The Joyce Family used it until 1972.

Bowman Dam is an earthen fill structure on the Crooked River that has created the Prineville Reservoir. The main input streams are the Crooked River and Bear Creek with lesser streams (Sanford Creek, Deer Creek, Alkali Creek, Antelope Creek, and Owl Creek) and the output stream is the Crooked River. The reservoir is for irrigation and flood control, which has allowed for all types of water recreational activities in the heart of high desert juniper and sage. The reservoir is open the year round and because of its location it is a great place for ice fishing (Dec-Feb) (using bait such as cheese, eggs, and worms).&nbsp;</p><p>Most human activity occurs at the State Park or on expansive water. To escape the human crowd and see more wildlife, drive east on a dirt road that follows the northeast shoreline for 6 miles to Combs Flat Road. That portion of the lake is more shallow and narrow, and the shoreline is mudflat, meadow, or willow shrubland. The northern-most length of this road parallels Crooked River, which is the reservoir&#39;s primary feeder stream.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>A back road from the State Park northeast to pavement at Combs Flat Road is muddy in the wet season and may be closed by pipe gates 0.3 mile and 2.6 miles from the respective termini.</p><p><strong>Boat launching is available at the following locations: </strong>Crook County Boat Ramp (US Bureau pf Reclamation), Jasper Point (state), Powderhouse Cove (US Bureau of Reclamation), Prineville Reservoir Resort (private), Prineville Reservoir State Park (state), and Roberts Bay East (US Bureau pf Reclamation).</p><ul><li><strong>Website:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"\">www.oregonstateparks.org</a></li></ul>",

For the first two and a half miles, the trail traverses and then climbs steadily in a north-northwest direction in the Smelter Gulch drainage.&nbsp; The trail then rises at a less rapid rate until treeline at about mile 2.7. The final 0.75 mile rises more rapidly in a series of switchbacks up to the shelf on which the lake is located. There are five major stream crossings on the trail. The first two are about 200 feet apart, and are located about 1 mile from the trailhead. Above the second major stream crossing, Smelter Gulch stream will be to the left (south) of the trail. At slightly over 1.3 miles from the trailhead, the trail makes two more stream crossings and the drainage will again be to the left (south) of the trail. At 2.5 miles, you will reach the fifth (and final) major stream crossing. From this point onward to the lake, the drainage is to the right (north) of the trail. As you reach treeline, the trail begins to pass through willows in which there frequently appear to be several trails that come and go. Continue in a north-northwest direction and maintain your elevation if you get confused. As you reach treeline, you will see on your right several series of cascading falls as the terrain steepens. The final stretch of the trail bends left (west) up a steep series of switchbacks on the tundra. In mid-summer, this final stretch of the trail has a spectacular display of wildflowers.</p><p>Note that the actual trail described above varies somewhat from how it is represented on the topographic quad map.</p>",

Wildflowers, wildlife and recreation opportunities abound on its five unique divisions--Cassia, Albion, Sublett, Raft River and Black Pine. The Cassia Division, 40 miles south of Twin Falls, contains over 450 miles of streams, including the main Rock Creek drainage, popular with many anglers. The Albion Division, located 20 miles southeast of Burley, is home to Cache Peak (10,339 ft.), which is the tallest peak in the Albion Mountain Range. The Sublett Division, located east of Idaho Interstate 84, offers fishing and camping near Sublett Reservoir. The Raft River Division, located in northern Utah, northwest of Salt Lake City, offers an expansive view from its 9,600 ft. mountain peaks of the Great Salt Lake, Snake River Plain, the Sawtooth Mountain Range and into the state of Nevada. The Black Pine Division located east of the Albion Division and west of Idaho Interstate 84 near the Idaho/Utah border, is popular for gathering pine nuts, the gourmet snack of the pinyon pine tree which grows abundantly in the area. Recreation is undoubtedly the most popular pursuit on the Minidoka Ranger District. Summer activities include camping, picnicing, hiking, rock climbing, horseback riding, mountain biking, and all-terrain vehicle trail machine riding. Winter brings opportunities for alpine and nordic skiing, and snowmachine travel. Hunting and fishing are popular on the District. Six alpine lakes, three reservoirs, and numerous streams are included within the District boundaries. Forested areas and rangeland provide habitat for wildlife species including mule deer, moose, elk, wild turkey, bobcat, cougar, many small mammals, and a wide variety of birds. The District manages (#?) camping units in 25 developed campgrounds.&nbsp; The district maintains over 341 miles of trails to meet needs for motorized and non-motorized use.</p>",

Nearly 350 miles of trails provide a wide range of routes and many of the high lake basins do not have constructed trails to reach them. The hiking season is short.&nbsp;Alpine wildflowers bring the high meadows alive with color in the months of July and August. An abundant population of wildlife thrives upon the lush, grassy meadows and many species of fish make their home in the thousands of streams that feed the headwaters of four major rivers.&nbsp; The Wilderness offers opportunities for recreational, scenic, scientific, educational, conservation and historic purposes.</p>",

In the center of this loop, an enormous berry bush, shrubbery and trees reach up to the sky, creating the visual heart of this intimate setting. Red-tail deer and small animals can be seen eating berries around the middle of the campground, giving campers a memorable sight to see. Each campsite is shaded by the natural growth of the oak and pine trees, creating a sequestered and private atmosphere.</p><p>A wide variety of shrubbery and trees decorate this beautiful area. The Santa Lucia mountain range graces you with wondrous shades of green, orange and yellow. Canyons and valleys burst with color and the oak woodlands provide important scenic landscapes and wildlife habitats. More than 90 species of birds can be found in this bird watcher&#39;s paradise. Deer, bobcats and small animals of all kinds can be seen regularly in this area. Whether they are just passing by or looking for some food to nibble on, they provide an unforgettable experience that can only come from the outdoors.</p><p>The White Oaks Campground is 2.7 miles from the Pine Ridge Trailhead. From the campground, follow the dirt road you drove in onward to China Camp. You are under the coverage of enormous pine trees and shady oaks with a view of hills as far as the eye can see. The Santa Lucia mountain range spreads out as valleys and hilltops that you never get tired of looking at. Once you reach the trailhead, you have&nbsp;miles of trail to explore.</p><p>Open daily, year-round. There are eight campsites located around a loop in the middle of the facility. While these campsites are mostly enjoyed by tent campers, RVs of 20 ft. or shorter could navigate into a campsite here as well. Each site includes a picnic table and fire ring. Fires are allowed only in designated fire rings. Pets are allowed. Two vault toilets are located near the campsites. You should plan to be completely self-sustainable for the duration of your trip.
