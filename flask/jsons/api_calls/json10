Remember conditions change. This is wild country so always pack enough water to make it several days in case your next water source turns out to be dry.<br /><strong>Woodenshoe Canyon:</strong><br />Four miles down the trail you will run into Cherry Canyon coming in from the right (looking down canyon). In the spring there is usually water coming out of Cherry Canyon and running for a mile or more downstream. In the fall it stops running down canyon, but I have never seen the spring in Cherry Canyon dry up completely, although I have seen it running pretty low and muddy. The next water source is approximately 7 miles downstream (although in the spring it is not unusual to find water in other locations as well) at an area known as Wates Pond. There is a large pothole and spring that usually holds water year round. Approximately 1 mile below Wates Pond, you will come to the Hanging Garden Spring that flows out of the canyon wall on the right and ",

A wilderness is a special area set aside by Congress which &ldquo;generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature with the imprint of man&rsquo;s work substantially unnoticeable&hellip;&rdquo; Before you start, be prepared with adequate supplies; water sources with the wilderness are not recommended for drinking, and must be purified if used. <strong>Group size is limited to 10 persons.</strong></p><p>This 7035-acre wilderness is located in northwestern Texas County. In the early 1800&rsquo;s Sylvester Paddy began the first logging of the area, transporting timber from this area by river to St. Louis. Until the 1930&rsquo;s the area was homesteaded and grazed as open range. It became federally designated wilderness in 1983.</p><p>Big Paddy and Little Paddy Creeks characterize the Paddy Creek Wilderness with steep cliffs and rock outcrops along the drainages. These creeks have water in them throughout most of the year. In the Wilderness are a few old fields in drainages but the rest is forested. Black, white, and post oaks, hickories and shortleaf pine are the main trees. Throughout the area, wildlife typical of the Missouri Ozarks is present. White-tailed deer, wild turkey, squirrel, rabbit, fox, coyote and bobcat are common.</p><p>A printable <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd594078.pdf\">brochure</a> (pdf format) is available for download.&nbsp;Trail System Map (<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd574644.pdf\">printable</a>) and Trail System Map <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd574645.pdf\">GEO Referenced</a> for use with Map Apps</p><p><strong>Trails: </strong>There ",

A long, narrow ridge supports the center of the Wilderness, with 1,020 feet as its highest &ldquo;vertebra.&rdquo; Thirteen miles of maintained foot and horse trails follow the Devils Backbone and four other ridges, dropping off into surrounding hollows in a forest dominated by oaks, hickories, and shortleaf pines. Elevations range from 1020 feet to 680 feet along the North Fork of the White River, a high quality, spring fed Ozark stream. Blue Spring, Amber Spring and McGarr Spring provide water to the river year-round.</p><p>Dogwood, redbud and wild azaleas give the wilderness a wild burst of color in the spring. Fall isn&rsquo;t to be outdone when the oaks, sweet gum, and sugar maple put on a show of yellow, oranges and reds. Scattered limestone glades and other openings provide some of the more favorable places to view wildlife. White-tailed deer, gray squirrel, raccoon, coyote, red and gray fox, bobcat and striped skunk are some of the mammals native to the area. Wild turkey, red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, bald eagle, turkey vulture, great blue heron, pileated woodpecker and various songbirds can be seen.

Shortleaf pine, oak, and hickory dominate the ridges today, and along the drainages you&rsquo;ll find hardwoods such as sycamore, ash, elm buckeye, and walnut.

The area's climate is truly unique for each season of the year. The weather is summarized as follows: 31 inches of average annual precipitation, 68 inches of snowfall, an average of 62 frost-free days, 59 degree F. average temperature May through September, and long cold winters.<br />Four-season recreation is Iron County's claim to fame. 2,175 lakes and 902 miles of streams offer unlimited challenges for both warm and cold-water fishing. Three rivers on the district have recently been designated as recreational rivers under the Wild and Scenic rivers Act. Northern hardwoods, pine, balsam fir, and spruce cover 80% of the county. More whitetail deer Boone and Crockett entries have been taken from the forests of Iron County than any other Michigan county. Add to this, the title of woodcock capital of the world and one cannot find any better small and big game hunting anywhere in the Midwest.<br />When winter arrives, it's no time to rest. 212 miles of snowmobile trails connect to a vast system of trails throughout upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin.

Many people drive out on Forest Service roads into the woods and find spots that meet the needs for their camp.<br />Dispersed camping may mean no toilet facilities or treated water are located nearby. Typically, dispersed camping is not allowed near developed recreation areas such as campgrounds, picnic areas or trailheads. Some dispersed sites are provided with fire rings and in those cases please use them as they are designating that area as the spot to safely have a campfire. Finally some dispersed sites have a designated footprint for use. If you see a site with any type of barriers or fencing please respect these areas by not pulling motor vehicles or OHV&rsquo;s.

It became one of the 8 initial units of the National Wild and Scenic River system in 1968. The Eleven Point River meanders through the picturesque Ozark hills of southern Missouri. Its course is cut in the shadows of steep bluffs, through sloping forested valleys, and low lying riparian ecosystems. Barely more than a small stream at its upper reaches near Thomasville, it gains considerable width and depth as its proceeds south-eastward. Springs pouring from dolomite bluffs or rushing up from a vast network of underground flow systems provide a continuous source of water and beauty. Alternating stretches of rapids and deep clear pools wind around moss covered boulders and shading bottomland hardwood trees.</p><p>ACCESS TO THE RIVER: There are currently eleven designated access points to the river by vehicle. Of these access points, 7 are managed to a standard that includes boat ramps and vault toilets. The remaining 4 access sites are managed to a lesser standard to encourage use by those wishing to avoid higher user densities. In addition, there are 8 float camps designated on the river to provide overnight camping for river users.</p><p>WHO CAN USE THE RIVER: The river has been designated for both motorized and non-motorized use. The motorized users must adhere to a 25 horsepower limit.</p><p>FISHING: There are opportunities aplenty for small mouth bass and pan fish. Special regulations apply. Go to <a href=\"https://www.mdc.mo.gov/\">www.mdc.mo.gov</a> for more information. Trout fishing starts at the confluence of the Greer spring branch and the river. Greer is the world&#39;s 10th biggest spring and doubles the size of the river while turning it into a cold water fishery. This is the beginning of the blue ribbon trout section which ex",

Beautiful flowers, tall shady trees, and graceful wildlife. The water flows clear and unpolluted from more than 30 major springs that feed it constantly and produce year round paddling conditions. There are some spots that will require walking and/ or portages as the river is not deep in some places, particularly in drought season. The rapids on the river are generally classified as Class I-II. There is a generous variety of fish in the river also, everything from crayfish to large mouth bass. You will need to check state regulations for fishing due to certain fishing limitations.</p>",

The project removed the failing Knutson Dam and reconnected the Mississippi River at the outlet of Cass Lake through construction of an innovative rock arch rapids.&nbsp; The project restored spawning habitat for a variety of warm water species such as walleye and white sucker.&nbsp; It enhanced aquatic organism passage to over 30 miles of river and more than 72,000 acres of lakes such as Cass Lake and Lake Winnibigoshish, which are world-class walleye fisheries.&nbsp; The project also improved recreational fishing access through the addition of a modern fishing pier, reduced the potential for lakeshore erosion on Cass Lake, and reduced the safety hazard of the former logging dam.</p>",

Heir to the Joyce Family fortune originating in part from lumber taken from northern Minnesota via the Itasca Lumber Company, David Joyce of Chicago built the estate from 1917-1935. Due to excellent railway connections from Minneapolis and Chicago, and its scenic beauty, the Grand Rapids area became nationally known as a major resort area. The Joyce Family used it until 1972.

But when they came up against the Blue Mountains, they hit the most rugged and treacherous part of their journey. Their guide, John McLeod, a fur trader from the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, chose the most direct route, but it was too steep and rugged for wagons, and only suitable for horse and foot travel. Though tough, their journey into the Oregon Country was the first completed by an Anglo family, proving that women and families could make it across, and pioneered the way for others to follow.</p><p>The Whitman Mission served both the local Indians and new emigrants along the Oregon Trail for eleven years. After a Black Measles epidemic broke out and almost 200 Cayuse Indians, mostly children, died, the Cayuse took revenge against the mission. The Whitmans, eleven others and the mission itself, met a violent end in the Whitman Massacre of November 29, 1847.</p><p>Over the years, the original trail used by the Whitmans was lost as a new wagon route was found and frequented. In the early 1960s, U.S. Forest Service Ranger Gerald Tucker used Narcissa&rsquo;s travel journal to locate the Whitman&rsquo;s crossing of the Blue Mountains. Today, the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/umatilla/recreation/recarea/?recid=57077\">Whitman Route Overlook</a>, a short drive from the Summit Guard Station, offers a spectacular view of Meacham Canyon and the Hell Hole Roadless Area, as well as a look back into the history of the area.</p><p>Summit Guard Station is located on high ridge nested in an open stand of large Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. The view to the south from this ridge-top setting is exceptional.</p><p>The rustic bunkhouse, with one multi-use room for cooking, sleeping and relaxing, is furnished with a table and four chairs and four bed frames with mattresses.

The lake is one of the highest elevation lakes around, capping 10,685 feet elevation and bordered by steep 12,000 foot peaks.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fishing in both the creek and lake offer promising catches of trout. Another noteworthy aspect of the campground is its access to the Colorado Trail.</p><p><strong>Natural Features: </strong>Aspen Campground, at 9,900 elevation, sits in a valley along Jefferson Creek at the base of Jefferson Hill. The single-loop campground is shaded by groves of aspen and mature spruce. Jefferson Lake, spanning about 182 acres, has deep, cold waters and freezes over in winter.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>The campground offers nearby access to two trails. Hiking, biking and horseback riding are excellent on the epic Colorado Trail, a 471-mile trail that stretches across Colorado from Denver to Durango. Also nearby is the West Jefferson Loop Trail, a foot path that goes up to the Continental Divide and loop for 11 miles.&nbsp;<br /><br />Rainbow, brown, mackinaw and brook trout can be found swimming in the creek and lake. No-wake boating is allowed in the lake and a boat ramp is easily accessible.</p><p><strong>Facilities: </strong>Amenities include picnic tables, vault toilets, drinking water from a hand pump and a campfire ring. Parking aprons are gravel and can fit up to two vehicles; maximum trailer length is 25 feet. &nbsp;There are 12 campsites at the campground.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is difficult to access Jefferson Lake Recreation Area during the winter months.

Soon after, the area became a haven for wealthy tourists who boated in the summer and skied in the winter. It remained popular until the 1950s, when enlargement of the lakes cut off access to the resort.</p><p>Today, Twin Lakes Village as well as <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/psicc/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=12481&amp;actid=50\">Interlaken Resort</a>, have been carefully preserved for visitors.

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>Vicksburg was founded in 1867 after prospectors from Leadville camping out in the Clear Creek Canyon lost their burros. The burros had wandered down the creek and when the miners found their pack animals, they discovered gold in the creek bed as well. In its heyday, Vicksburg had a post office, school, blacksmith, two hotels, two billiard halls, several saloons, a general store, an assay office, and a livery stable. Early miners packed in Balm of Gilead balsam poplar trees on the backs of burros and planted them to line the street. The trees still stand today and are watered by ditches leading from Vicksburg Creek into the town. The ditches were dug on either side of the street to provide a water system; wooden boxes were built in the ditches to keep food cold and provide water to fight fires. A daily stage ran from Vicksburg to Granite at a fare of 50 cents.</p><p>Located near Vicksburg but dating to the 1930s is the Crescent Moly Mine and Mining Camp. However, the Moly mine was not a gold mine but was associated with the molybdenum boom and the nearby Climax mine phenomenon. Both Vicksburg and the Crescent Moly Mine are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>A mile further down the valley Pine Creek empties into the Arkansas and evidence remains of prospecting and mining in this area as well. The Colorado Historical Society lists the Littlejohn mine camp on the north bank of Pine Creek:</p><p>Located in the Pine Creek mining district, structures in the complex include a cabin, a burro shed/bunk house, a forge, and several related outbuildings. All date from the 1880s and are constructed of hand hewn logs with A and V joints. Low pitch gabled roofs were made of logs, mud, dirt, and grass. Such intact examples of early log mining camps are rare as many were quickly abandoned or replaced with wood frame or masonry structures. Harry Littlejohn, who acquired the property in 1920 and lived and worked there until his death in 1952, is credited with maintaining the integrity of the complex.</p>",

McCormick Wilderness has recovered from the logging era that ended in the early 1900&#39;s. Today, you&#39;ll find a mixture of northern hardwoods and lowland conifers interspersed with small patches of towering white pine, Michigan&#39;s State Tree. Straddling the divide between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, this region ranges from nearly level terrain to rocky cliffs. McCormick&#39;s water is what draws most visitors, with the Huron, Dead, Pahokee, and the Wild and Scenic Yellow Dog Rivers all have part of their headwaters within the wilderness. Many cascading waterfalls on the Yellow Dog make it unnavigable. The Yellow Dog is one of a few Eastern rivers designated &quot;Wild&quot;. Eighteen small lakes add sparkle to the landscape. Trout, pike, and bass live here, but only in small numbers due to the less-than-fertile-waters. The three mile White Lake Trail connects County Road 607 to White Deer Lake where the McCormick Estate once stood. Remnants of old, unmaintained trails can sometimes be found, but the rest of the Wilderness is fairly rugged, isolated, unspoiled, and relatively difficult to access.</p><p>McCormick Wilderness <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3834933.pdf\">Map</a></p>",

This mountain, usually considered one of the easiest of Colorado&#39;s 54 Fourteeners, is an excellent climb for beginning mountaineers, but basic mountaineer rules still apply.&nbsp;The peak is named for the Union General William T. Sherman who, during the Civil War, practiced a scorched earth policy while marching to Atlanta in 1854.</p><p>Sherman, Colorado&#39;s 46th highest peak, is a fast hike for a reasonably fit person since it is possible to park as high as 12,000 feet, leaving only a couple thousand feet of elevation gain to the summit and a round-trip hike of just over five miles. Like all the Fourteeners though, Mount Sherman needs to be treated with respect. Thunderstorms brew over the Sawatch Range to the west and move in quickly. It always seems windy on Sherman&#39;s upper ridge and summit. It&#39;s necessary to get an early start, carry rain gear, and keep an eye on the weather for thunderstorms.</p><p>Keep in mind that this mountain is on a mining claim owned by the Day Mine Company in Leadville. This is located on <strong>private property </strong>and is not public land. Misuse of this trail could lead to closure.

Staley, as the Lakeside Resort in the 1870s,&nbsp;this was a popular mountain hotel, ringing with laughter and music. Lush bluegrass lawns beneath towering pine and spruce, sparkling water fountains, gardens of native and cultivated flowers blooming throughout the summer enhanced the picturesque setting. In 1883, millionaire James V. Dexter, expanded Lakeside into a world-class resort, re-named the hotel Interlaken, and added 2,000 acres.</p><p>Relative luxury in a rustic mountain setting provided escape for the wealthy. Guests first journeyed by train to Granite (five miles east of Twin Lakes) where they boarded a side-seated platform wagon to the resort. A boardwalk led them from the stage stop to the hotel porch.</p><p>Culture was not forgotten at this rustic resort. Every week during the summer an orchestra came from Leadville to play in the pavilion, where oil paintings of the Civil War covered the walls. Billiard tables, inlaid with rare woods and ivory, provided another luxury. Guests could also spend their days playing cards, picnicking, horseback riding or hiking. Activites such as skating, skiing, and sleigh riding continued through the winter. Sleds driven by teams of horses brought visitors from Leadville across the frozen lake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This area does not allow camping.

Hikers and horseback riders can follow a 3-mile section of the Santa Fe National Historic&nbsp;Trail to Sierra Vista Overlook. Start your hike at the nature trail and walk northwest to the stone trail post or, if you are on horseback, start your ride at the stock tank, following the fence northwest to the gate. From there turn northwest and go through the gate following the stone trail posts to Sierra Vista.</p>",

The rim trail continues upriver for another half mile to the Upper Falls Overlook and day use area, then eventually all the way to Algoma (15 miles).

Trailblazers can choose any where between a scenic, quarter-mile hike to Backbone Creek (particularly colorful in autumn) to a 19-mile+ backcountry mountain excursion that continues through an extensive forest trail system. Big and Little Boulder Lake Trail is an easy and rewarding two mile hike leading to sights of impressive granite walls, deep blue waters, conifer forests and showy wildflowers. Hobo Gulch to Grizzly Lake Trail is for the experienced hiker; trail affords views of a large alpine lake and a 70-foot waterfall. A popular choice is Stuart Fork Trail that starts from Bridge Camp Campground. The trail has very little elevation variation, good fishing opportunities and the option of continuing 15 miles to Sapphire Lake.</p><p>Mountain biking is a popular pastime on the TRMU. Several trails afford experiences for the novice and experienced biker. Some trails are moderately strenuous requiring the rider and bike to be in fairly good shape. The scenic vistas are worth the effort: Trinity Alps, Trinity Divide and Trinity Lake. A great mountain bike ride for people of all experience levels is along the Minersville Trail that parallels the shoreline of Trinity Lake.</p><p>Anglers will find cold, clear running streams on the unit providing excellent catches of steelhead, silver salmon and Chinook salmon in the Trinity River and native rainbow trout in tributary creeks and streams.</p>",

It is an irrigation impoundment that is situated near the headwaters of Bear Creek, a tributary of the Crooked River, and is formed by a 33-foot high earth fill dam at the west end of Antelope Flat. The landscape includes a nice mix of ponderosa pine, desert slopes, and weedy banks. Expect to find murky water conditions. Rainbow trout are found in the reservoir and average 12 inches although there have been reports of a high growth rate and good success by anglers with fish as large as 18 inches. Fingerlings are stocked in mid-May by ODFW. Early in the season, anglers line the bank near the concrete boat ramp and close to the rocks. The water is frequently turbid because of the growth of phytoplankton and because of bank erosion caused by surface waves, thus decreasing water transparency.</p><p><strong>A cement boat ramp is near the dam for launching your watercraft.</strong><br />&nbsp;</p>",

The final 0.75 mile rises more rapidly in a series of switchbacks up to the shelf on which the lake is located. There are five major stream crossings on the trail. The first two are about 200 feet apart, and are located about 1 mile from the trailhead. Above the second major stream crossing, Smelter Gulch stream will be to the left (south) of the trail. At slightly over 1.3 miles from the trailhead, the trail makes two more stream crossings and the drainage will again be to the left (south) of the trail. At 2.5 miles, you will reach the fifth (and final) major stream crossing. From this point onward to the lake, the drainage is to the right (north) of the trail. As you reach treeline, the trail begins to pass through willows in which there frequently appear to be several trails that come and go. Continue in a north-northwest direction and maintain your elevation if you get confused. As you reach treeline, you will see on your right several series of cascading falls as the terrain steepens. The final stretch of the trail bends left (west) up a steep series of switchbacks on the tundra. In mid-summer, this final stretch of the trail has a spectacular display of wildflowers.</p><p>Note that the actual trail described above varies somewhat from how it is represented on the topographic quad map.</p>",

Dense thickets of willow and brush follow the stream course. Hillsides are dominated by mixed conifer and stands of park-like ponderosa pine. Ridge-tops are predominantly open sagebrush with some mountain mahogany. Deer and elk are common year round. The lucky observer may also see bear, coyote, mountain lion, or possibly wolverines! Beware of rattlesnakes, especially in stream bottoms.</p><p>Walk down through geologic time, from the rim to Black Canyon creek, from Boeing Field to the South Fork of the John Day River; each successive basalt flow is older than the last. Black Canyon Wilderness is a layer cake of 17 million-year-old Picture Gorge Basalt flows, stacked one on top of the other.</p><p>The 18 miles of maintained trail offer easy access throughout the wilderness. Be prepared to ford streams as there are no bridges. The 12-mile <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ochoco/recreation/recarea/?recid=38572\">Black Canyon Trail (#820</a>)&nbsp;cuts through a narrow gorge, requiring hikers to cross rushing water at least a dozen times. The creek is typically un-fordable at high water, usually January through March.

The peaks of East Point and North Point look across the wilderness from 6,625 feet and 6,607 feet, respectively.</p><p>The benches and springs in Bridge Creek are the result of massive landslides, heavy basalts cascading down weathered clay zones within the underlying volcanic terrain. Pisgah Lookout sits up on basalt rim, overlooking the wilderness.</p><p>The forest is mostly fir and larch with streaks of pine and clearings of sagebrush and bunchgrass. Stands of white fir and lodgepole pine are found in the central core of the wilderness. Most of the 30 inches of annual precipitation falls as winter snow. There are five perennial springs in the wilderness, including the Thompson, Pisgah, Masterson, Nelson, and Maxwell springs. Wildlife prominent in the area include elk, coyote, rabbit and many raptors and cavity nesting birds.</p><p>Orientation skills are a must for traveling because <strong>there are no maintained trails in Bridge Creek Wilderness</strong>. Off-trail hiking through the tangled understory tends to be difficult. Wind has stunted the trees and opened the country around North Point; a hike of about 1.2 miles from near Pisgah Springs along an abandoned jeep track will take you to the summit. Another abandoned trail leads about 1.5 miles to the summit of East Point.</p><p>In 2008, the Bridge Creek Fire burned most of the wilderness to stand replacement conditions. It is now more accessible with greater line-of-sight vistas. <strong>Please use caution</strong> as many trees have been weakened and present additional danger.</p><ul><li><strong>Elevation range</strong>: 5,200&#39; to 6,607&#39;</li><li><strong>Key access points:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ochoco/recarea/?recid=79447#accessbridgecreek\">Bridge Creek Wilderness access information</a></li></ul><p><style type=\"text/css\">.embed-container {position: r",
