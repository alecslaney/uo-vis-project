The road continues over Bolam Pass to Colorado Highway 145 north of Rico. The upper section is 4WD only.The upper trailhead for the Hermosa Creek Trail begins 2 miles past the campground, near the confluence of the main and east forks of Hermosa Creek. This multiple-use trail heads back to the town of Hermosa through the Hermosa Roadless Area. The trail offers a technical single-track experience for mountain bikes (at 19 miles, taking most of a day, including shuttle drops). A few camping sites are available at the trailhead, which has a toilet, picnic tables, fire grates, corral, and parking area.</p>",

The trail passes through dense forests of standing dead trees, killed or weakened by either the fire or bark beetle infestation. For example, over two weeks in June, a district trail crew cleared approximately 250 dead and downed trees lying across the first five miles of the trail between the trailhead and hot springs.</p><p>About half of the West Fork Trail between the trailhead and hot springs is impacted and may pose safety issues, and conditions currently make travel by pack animals dangerous in certain sections. One portion of the trail near the hot springs is washed out and not recommended for stock travel at this time. Wilderness crews plan to work on this section this month to try to improve conditions. In addition, burned-out stumps have left multiple large holes along one mile of the trail between the first two bridge crossings, also making stock travel treacherous and foot travel difficult. The bridges, however, are in good shape, although one bridge did sustain damage from a falling dead tree. Its hand rails have been rebuilt and the bridge inspected.</p><p>Visitors are also reminded that camping near the hot springs can be dangerous because the root systems of the multiple standing dead trees in the area may not be intact and are very susceptible to wind throw. Past the hot springs, Forest Service crews have cleared standing dead trees along switchbacks, but at the top of the pass, the trail is washed out and deemed impassable to stock travel. In addition, crews have not yet cleared downed trees across the trail past the switchbacks.</p>",

Do not park directly in front of the trail or you may be ticketed, or plowed in by the snowplow. Follow the old logging road 1.5 miles into a giant clear-cut. This area is good for skiing and snowshoeing only if there is adequate snow - otherwise there are logs and stumps. The trail forks here. For the more adventurous, continue west across the clear cut and follow faint old roads and trails towards timberline. The left fork continues about 1.5 miles, and the right fork about 2 miles as the Sawmill Creek drainage continues to steepen. Near timberline pick your way up into either the north or south cirques of Sawmill Creek. While the skiing is fantastic up here, so is the avalanche danger.",

This road is graveled from U.S. Highway 84 for three miles. The remainder is not graveled and is extremely slick and hazardous when wet. Monsoon rains make this road impassable. High clearance vehicle and four-wheel drive is recommended. Large RVs or camper trailers are allowed but not recommended because of the road.</p><p><strong>General Information:</strong></p><p>Be extremely cautious with fire and use only the fireplaces provided. Please do not cut down trees or shrubs; they provide natural scenery and shade-not firewood. Please do not carve on the trees. Carving leaves a wound where fungus can enter and kill the tree.</p><p>Please do not deposit fish remains in the lakes and clean fish away from the water. Please wrap fish remains and other highly spoilage meats, food, etc., in small plastic bags, then in bread wrappers, and/or newspapers. Pack out all trash on your way out of the campground and fishing area.</p><p>Please pick up litter around your campsite and pack it out with you.

The 12-site campground is located along the central Oregon coast, 22 miles south of the town of Reedsport, and 2 miles north of Coos Bay.&nbsp;The year-round campground is equipped with drinking water, vault toilets, a picnic area, trash bins and recycling receptacles. Horses are welcome in the 12 corrals provided.&nbsp;Head to Horsfall Campground for the use of token operated showers.</p><p>Some parts of the dunes are designated for hiking and horseback riding only, while off-road vehicle enthusiasts can roam free on the dunes north of the campground. Horse campers come here to explore the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recreation/recarea/?recid=42665\">Wild Mare Horse Trail</a> which begins at the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recreation/recarea/?recid=42645\">Wild Mare Day Use</a> under a canopy of alder and spruce, and then emerges into an open dune area that crosses down to the beach.</p><h3>History of the Wild Mare</h3><p>In the mid-twentieth century, the Nels Peterson family of Coos County, Oregon raised livestock, providing animals for rodeos. They leased property for grazing, including the dunes along ocean beaches.</p><p>In 1954 they took a group of horses to the dunes. One horse was a year-old filly. A year later, when the Petersons weren&rsquo;t able to use that area any longer, they rounded up the horses to transport them to another place. As the animals were being herded into a corral, the filly, then two years old, jumped over the eight-foot fence and ran into the dunes.</p><p>The Petersons tried many times to catch her, even using relay teams to run her down, but she always escaped. After an announcement that anyone could have the horse if they could catch her, other people tried. But her brown coloring was good camouflage and her splayed hoofs enabled her to run through woods, water, wet sand, and steep-sided dunes.</p><p>Known as the Wild Mare,",

You&#39;ll need to travel cross country using a map and compass - a real wilderness experience.</p><p>Pristine rain forest canyons run with crystalline water pouring into either Rock Creek itself in the heart of the Wilderness or Big Creek on the southern boundary. Mossy big leaf maple and red alder hang suspended over both creeks as they make their way toward the salty waves of the Pacific Ocean. Near the coast, tremendous old-growth Sitka spruce sometimes reach nine feet in diameter, giving way to old Douglas fir farther inland. Pink-blossomed rhododendron bloom in May, joining salal, salmonberry, and sword fern in their efforts to keep the ground perpetually shaded.</p><p>Look carefully for Oregon Silverspot butterflies on the tall ridge between Rock and Big Creeks; these orange-and-brown butterflies live only here and in two other places on earth. Salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat trout migrate up creek to spawn.</p><p>Fog cools the area almost all of every summer; and winters are usually snow free.</p><p><style type=\"text/css\">.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 80%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;} small{position: absolute; z-index: 40; bottom: 0; margin-bottom: -15px;}</style></p><div class=\"embed-container\"><small><a href=\"//usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=51f650f63d534c7a9d8f76c8faf3fd40&amp;extent=-124.1026,44.1506,-123.9825,44.2127&amp;home=true&amp;zoom=true&amp;scale=true&amp;legend=true&amp;basemap_gallery=true&amp;disable_scroll=true&amp;theme=light\" style=\"color:#0000FF;text-align:left\" target=\"_blank\">View larger map</a></small><br /><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=51f650f63d534c7a9d8f76c8faf3fd40&amp;ex",

Many plants and animals, including some found in few other places, call this area home. In 1972, Congress designated this 31,500-acre portion of the Siuslaw National Forest as a National Recreation Area in recognition of its unique values.

Take in great views of the dunes and Pacific Ocean from wheel-chair accessible viewing platforms or hike through the dunes and coastal forest to the ocean. As one of the several areas of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area that is closed to Off Highway Vehicles (OHVs), dune explorers will find exceptional hiking from the dunes&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/siuslaw/?cid=fsbdev7_007155\">transition forest</a> to the beach and sand.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recreation/recarea/?recid=42469\">Oregon Dunes Loop Trail</a> is paved for the first half-mile to a viewing area. From there the trail takes visitors down into the dunes. There are two main hiking options. The popular 2-mile round-trip out to the beach and back follows a fairly-level and hard-packed trail through the sand to the beach. Those who want a longer hike and more solitude can follow the trail to the beach then walk south along the beach for about 1.5 miles to the exit point back through the dunes. The trail follows large post markers through deep sand.</p><p>During the summer months, ranger-led talks are available most days at the Oregon Dunes Day Use Area and guided hikes are available most weekends. Jr. Ranger evening programs are also held at different locations throughout the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.

The ghost town of Stunner is just east of the campground. This was a mining town that failed due to nonproducing mines and transportation problems. Parts of the town are private property, so pack out all your trash and observe posted trespassing signs.  Stunner Campground is beside the Alamosa River 2 miles below the top of Stunner Pass. There are 10 campsites with tables, fireplaces, vault type toilet, ample parking and a developed water system operated with a hand pump. Firewood is limited. Convenient trailer spaces available. The Alamosa River is nearby for fishing, unfortunately, naturally acidic water severely limits fishing in the Alamosa River between Stunner Campground and Terrace Reservoir. Big game hunting is possible. Stunner is a ghost town of historic significance. Please pack your trash. Obtain permission before entering any private property in the area.  Stunner, never very big, has long been a ghost town with ghost mines on both sides of the Alamosa. The names of its mines have a special flavor -- the Orpheus, Cornucopia, the Merrimac, Log Cabin, and Snow Storm, and as always, a mine named for a wife, daughter or sweetheart, the Louise. Only those mines north of the river shipped payable ore; those south, shipped no ore. Stunner, like the Platoro camp south across the mountain to the left, had transportation problems. The government road had washed out by 1885 and was not repaired because of the discontinuance of the forts at Fort Garland and at Pagosa Springs, and the construction of a railroad over Cumbres Pass to the south. This meant mail was delivered by pack trains and post riders in the summer and on skis in the winter.  The ink-blue, fringed gentians bloom in the meadow in late August.

Vault toilets are provided but there is no drinking water.</p><p>A historic picnic shelter built by the Civil Conservation Corps in 1937, and restored in 2016, is available for day use at the Hebo Lake Day Use site. The 1/2 mile Hebo Lake Loop Trail is a pleasant hike around the lake, and access to the Pioneer - Indian Trail is nearby. Anglers will find five accessible fishing docks around the popular three-acre lake, which is stocked with rainbow trout.</p><p>Check out this video from Travel Oregon&#39;s &quot;Grant&#39;s Getaways&quot; for great views of the campground.&nbsp;(The Hebo Lake Campground footage is about halfway through the video.)</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dVV3Ki0NPsk?rel=0\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>",

At the old log house, the Russell Family provided overnight lodging and good home-cooked meals for weary travelers. As many as 80 visitors stayed in the house at one time when the Chattooga River, just up the road, was too deep to cross. The self-sufficient farmstead included ten outbuildings clustered around the main house. Many of life&rsquo;s necessities were made in the sheds and the blacksmith shop. The spring house provided drinking water and served as a refrigerator. A fire destroyed the main house and three outbuildings in 1988, leaving only a chimney of the main house. The farmstead is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. An interpretive sign on the site details the layout of the farmstead as well as much of the above information.</p>",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>The Vasquez Peak Wilderness was congressionally established in 1993. It encompasses 12,300 acres of tundra and spruce/fir forest in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in Grand County, Colorado. Edward Berthoud named Vasquez Peak, the highest point in the Wilderness at 12,947 feet. Berthoud was the founder and engineer of the mountain pass through the Rocky Mountains into the Middle Park area of Colorado, now known as Berthoud Pass.</p><p>The Vasquez Peak Wilderness is bordered by the Winter Park Ski Area to the north; the Fraser Experimental Forest to the west; Berthoud Pass (Highway 40) road to the east; and Jones Pass and the Henderson Mine to the south. This high country Wilderness sits entirely above 10,000 feet with over half of its area above timberline.</p><p>There are over 15 miles of trail across the alpine tundra and only one trail that climbs through a spruce/fir forest. These trails lead up to two small lakes, across six peaks above 12,500 feet in elevation, and above numerous small creeks that start in high alpine basins. Along the southern boundary of Vasquez Peak Wilderness the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail offers opportunities for solitude and views.</p><p>With much of the trail system above timberline, sudden summer thunderstorms can make exposure to lightning in the Vasquez Mountains a dangerous risk. Plan on hiking early and dropping into the trees before afternoon storms break. In winter, avalanches are common.</p><p>Always use&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lnt.org/learn/7-principles%22\" target=\"-blank\">Leave No Trace</a>&nbsp;techniques to help keep this area wild, clean, and pristine.</p>",

There are many species of birds including the red-tailed hawk, white-tailed ptarmigan, golden eagle, raven, Steller&#39;s Jay and a variety of warblers. Lakes and streams are inhabited with lake, cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout.

There are ample opportunities for sports and recreation for the whole family.</p><p>Crow Valley sits at an elevation of 4,800 feet.

However, the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recreation/recarea/?recid=32175\">group campsites </a>have little to no shade. Short grass prairie surrounds the recreation area. The Pawnee National Grassland sits east of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Eroding creek drainages crisscross the area. Elevations range from 4,900 feet on the prairie to 9,500 feet at the summit of the Pawnee Buttes.</p><p>Birding, exploring nature trails, viewing wildlife and star gazing are popular activities at Crow Valley. A volleyball court, horseshoe pit and ball field are available. The <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recreation/recarea/?recid=32183\">Lee and Dorothy Rhoads Farm Implement Museum</a> is located within the recreation area.

Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan.

Here, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the &quot;toilet bowl.&quot; The fish feed on Mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake.</p><p>The stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife Commission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of 2 fish over 14 inches.</p><p>For hikers and bikers, the Ruedi Trail, located north of the reservoir, climbs to the top of Red Table Mountain. The trailhead is located 200 feet north of the Jeep trail near the boat ramp and parking lot. This 8-mile trail gains over 3,000 feet in elevation, leading hikers to a spectacular panoramic view of the area.</p><p>Boating, swimming, and water skiing are all possible in the area.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>:</p><p>Dearhamer Campground has 13 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers, and RVs.

The Ranger Station is the second oldest building of its kind in the United States, having been built in 1910. James Cayton and his wife Birdie (a school teacher) built the cabin and were the first individuals to live in the structure. In addition to serving as James and Birdie&rsquo;s home, the station functioned as the headquarters for managing what was then known as the Grand River Ranger District on the Battlement National Forest. James and Birdie conducted a variety of official activities while living and working at the Ranger Station, including: surveying boundaries, posting signs, building and repairing telephone lines, inspecting homestead claims, monitoring ranchers&rsquo; cattle, selling hunting licenses, and looking after the station&rsquo;s garden and livestock.</p><p style=\"margin: 1em 0px;\">The Cayton Ranger Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Today, visitors can interact with and learn about the Station in a variety of ways. Visitors can take a hike up Cayton Gulch, explore the grounds, or enjoy a picnic near the Station. Visitors can also look inside the interior of the cabin, which is still decorated as it appeared when James and Birdie lived on site. Interpretive brochures and posters available outside the Station provide information about the lives of James and Birdie, as well as the history of the structure.</p><p style=\"margin: 1em 0px;\">The Forest Service manages this site in partnership with the Cayton Ranger Station Foundation. The Station is available for special events, and the Foundation also periodically hosts interpretive programming on the grounds. ",

At the heart of the area, the Pine Creek Cookhouse is the premier Aspen dining experience for cross-country skiers, snowshoers, nature lovers and gourmands. Originally built in 1971 and destroyed by fire in April 2003, the Pine Creek Cookhouse&mdash;spectacularly re-created as an authentic log cabin of native Colorado logs&mdash; once again delights diners with unique mountain gourmet cuisine. Guests leave their cars behind at the historic Ghost Town of Ashcroft to cross country ski, snowshoe, or ride the horse drawn sleigh to the Cookhouse.For lunch, skiers enjoy freshly made soup or wild game goulash along with the famous &quot;Skier&rsquo;s Banquet&quot;&mdash;a fresh array of greens, grains, pastas, and seafood salads. At dinner, take a guided ski adventure by miner&rsquo;s light or a romantic sleigh ride to the Cookhouse, then enjoy such legendary traditions as Porcini Dusted Elk or Jack Daniels Marinated Caribou. Wild game doesn&rsquo;t appeal? The wild Alaskan Salmon, Rainbow Trout, and vegetarian specials will please the most finicky palette.Serving lunch daily noon to 2:00 p.m., and d inner nightly arrival time 6:30 p.m. to ski or sleigh to the Cookhouse Reservation Hotline: 970-925-1044; King Cabin Ski Hut:970- 925-1971 www.pinecreekcookhouse.com</p>",

Carhart&rsquo;s task was to survey the area to build a recreational housing development of summer cottages.

Either choice will lead visitors through serene forest with occasional breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.</p><p>Please note that this area is an active cattle allotment during the summer. Due to its lower elevation, the West Mamm Creek Trailhead may be accessible earlier in the spring and later in the fall than many other Forest Service recreation sites (but please check with your local Ranger District office before heading out).</p><p>View a map of the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd637556.pdf\">West Mamm Trailhead</a> and vicinity here (.pdf file)&nbsp;</p>",
