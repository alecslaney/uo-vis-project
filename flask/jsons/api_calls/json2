One campsite meets accessibility standards. The facility is equipped with campfire rings, flush toilet restrooms and coin-operated showers.&nbsp;Part of the campground is fenced off to protect the habitat of the endangered Laguna Skipper butterfly. Visitors are asked to respect the fence boundary and comply with the maximum site occupancy.</p><p>The campground sits at an elevation of 6,000 ft. in the Laguna Mountains. It is forested with pines and oaks that provide plenty of shade, in addition to a meadow. The area is home to many species of birds, as well as the endangered Laguna Skipper butterfly.&nbsp;Little Laguna lake is located just a short distance from the campground and is an excellent hiking destination for photographers and visitors looking to explore the area.</p><p>The Laguna Mountain Recreation Area is known for great horseback riding, mountain biking and hiking trails. Visitors can get their boots dusty on the Laguna Meadow Trail system or access a segment of the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail, which runs from California to the State of Washington.&nbsp;Wildflowers are usually abundant in April and May on the Big Laguna Trail, which takes visitors past Big Laguna Lake. In wet years there is water in Big Laguna Lake by December or January and ducks and other birds can be found.&nbsp;The trail presents a number of options to the user. A return to the trailhead parking can be made by cutting through the Laguna Campground or by taking the Pacific Crest Trail north.&nbsp;Families can learn about the area&#39;s flora and fauna by attending educational programs at the facility&#39;s amphitheater.

The ridge is open with scattered trees providing breathtaking panoramic views of the Pend Oreille and Columbia River valleys as well as the Kettle Crest. Wildflowers and huckleberries can be found during the late season and don&#39;t miss out on exploring the old Abercrombie Lookout that can be reached by going north where the established trail ends.</p><p>Provides access to:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/colville/recarea/?recid=67972\">Abercrombie Mountain Trail #117</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/colville/recarea/?recid=68024\">North Fork Silver Creek Trail #119</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/colville/recarea/?recid=68050\">South Fork Silver Creek Trail #123</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/colville/recarea/?recid=67924\">Flume Creek Trail #502</a></li></ul><p>See also:</p><ul><li>Northeast Washington Trail Guide<a href=\"http://newashingtontrails.com/Abercrombie\">Abercrombie Mt #117</a></li><li>Northeast Washington Trail Guide <a href=\"http://newashingtontrails.com/NorthForkSilverCreek\">North Fork Silver Creek #119</a></li></ul>",

This area is good for skiing and snowshoeing only if there is adequate snow - otherwise there are logs and stumps. The trail forks here. For the more adventurous, continue west across the clear cut and follow faint old roads and trails towards timberline. The left fork continues about 1.5 miles, and the right fork about 2 miles as the Sawmill Creek drainage continues to steepen. Near timberline pick your way up into either the north or south cirques of Sawmill Creek. While the skiing is fantastic up here, so is the avalanche danger.",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>Patterson Glacier is a Special Interest Area encompassing about 14,000 acres. It is located about 10 miles west of Petersburg, Alaska. Like the Baird Glacier, it is a western outlet of the Stikine Icefield. This 14- mile long glacier does not reach tidewater. Instead it flows into the 2- mile long Patterson Lake, then Patterson River, and eventually into Thomas Bay. Due to rapid glacial retreat over the past thirty years, Patterson Lake has grown large enough for floatplanes to land, thus greatly increasing the recreation potential of this area. The Patterson Glacier is losing ice at a rate of about 135 feet per year at the terminus, so icebergs can be seen in the lake. There are no recreation facilities&nbsp;such as cabins or shelters at the glacier, though other FS cabins such as <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79040&amp;actid=101\"><strong>Spurt Cove</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78998&amp;actid=101\"><strong>Cascade Creek</strong></a> are nearby in Thomas Bay. Forest Service developed hiking opportunities in the area of Thomas Bay include Falls Lake and Swan Lake trails.</p><p><strong>Planning your trip &ndash;&nbsp;</strong><em>May through September </em>are the best months to visit as floatplane and hiking in are advisable during this period. The valley and creek outlet that are south of the lake has flat areas for camping. No special permit is needed to visit the area.</p><p><strong>Getting There -&nbsp;</strong>The easiest way to access the area is by floatplane. However, visitors can hike several miles along an old logging road on the north side of the river (and south of Delta Creek) to reach an area close to the lake. Hikers can boat or floatplane to Thomas Bay to gain access to the old roadbed north of the river. A kayak, waders, or small raft is necessary from the boat to the beach near the old road. Small pack rafts will be necessary in order to access other areas o",

Hikers can challenge themselves with the 12.3-mile Art Loeb Trail, the 3.7-mile North Slope Trail or a 1.5-mile walking trail.&nbsp;The Davidson River offers excellent trout fishing, plus tubing and swimming, which are kid-friendly favorite activities. Visitors wishing to learn more about the area can attend educational programs in summer and fall.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Campsites are organized into eight loops and some are adjacent to the water. Sites are mostly shaded and equipped with picnic tables, tent pads, lantern posts and campfire rings with grills. The facility also provides hot showers and restrooms with flush toilets in each loop. Campers can purchase ice and firewood on-site and rent bikes nearby.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions:&nbsp;</strong>Several natural and cultural attractions are within close proximity to the campground. Sliding Rock, Looking Glass Falls and the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway are among the more popular sites.
