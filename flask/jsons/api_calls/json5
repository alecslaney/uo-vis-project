The Newberry Caldera encircles the basins of Paulina and East lakes and it is nearly 5 miles (8 km) in diameter. This collapsed <em>caldera&nbsp;</em>is the result of more than 500,000 years of volcanic activity. Neither lake receives water from an inlet stream. Both lakes rely on rain, snowmelt, and hot springs for water. Although these lakes are twins and share much in common, they are not at all identical.</p><p>Paulina Lake, the larger twin, is the deepest at 250 feet (76 m). Paulina Creek drains this lake and has chiseled a narrow gorge through the caldera&#39;s west wall creating a remarkable twin waterfall. Thermal vents and hot springs along the lake&#39;s northeast edge help create a highly productive ecosystem. The lake fed by snowmelt, hot springs, and groundwater flows from East Lake. The outlet stream from the lake is Paulina Creek that flows westward into the Little Deschutes River. The lake covers an area of 1531 acres. The average depth of the lake is 163 feet with a maximum depth of 250 feet.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38446\">Paulina Lake Day Use Area</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38402\">Little Crater Boating Site&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and Paulina Lake Resort.</p><p>Click here for information on <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5447133.docx\">Paulina Hot Springs</a>.</p>",

This historic lookout is available for rent during the snow-free season. Guests must bring most of their own amenities.</p><p><strong>Natural Features</strong></p><p>From the lookout, guests are treated to expansive views of the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/rogue-siskiyou/recarea/?recid=77583\"><strong>Red Buttes Wilderness Area</strong></a>, Squaw Lake and the Little Applegate Valley. To the north are expansive views of the Rogue Valley and Mt. McLoughlin, and to the east is Wagner Butte and Dutchman Peak. On a clear day, visitors can see the rim of Crater Lake, Mt. Bailey and Mt. Thielson. Clear nights provide guests with a dazzling display of stars and planets.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong></p><p>The 14 x 14 foot one-room cabin is designed to house only one or two people, and offers a primitive camping experience. The room is equipped with a small wooden table, and the center of the building has a working Osborne Firefinder on its work table. Broom, mop, and fire extinguisher are on site, as well as a small storage box with toilet paper, Forest and Ranger District maps, and information about the lookout and its surroundings. A primitive vault toilet is located near the lookout. No water is available on site, so guests must pack in water for drinking, cooking and washing.

Keep your eyes open for sandhill cranes, Canada geese, ducks, elk, and deer.</p><p>A campground host is onsite between Memorial Day and Labor Day to answer any questions about the campground, the nineteen miles of maintained horse trails, or about the surrounding area in general. As volunteers, our hosts provide a great service for our visitors. If they make contact and ask you to comply with a specific regulation, they are only doing what the Forest Service has asked them to do. Please respect this, and if you have disagreement, contact the Butte Falls Ranger District.</p><p>The Willow Prairie Guard Station was constructed on the edge of the meadow in 1924 by a Forest Service road crew. Its main purpose at that time was as a firefighter guard station. The original cabin was recently restored by local volunteers and employees of the Butte Falls Ranger District. These volunteers represented the Rogue Snowmobile Club, Boy Scouts, and the Coalition of Equestrian Clubs.</p><p>The Campground has been in existence since the 1950&#39;s. In 1990, it was converted to a horse camp with 19 miles of interconnecting trails. This renovation was through a partnership with the Forest Service and the Coalition of Equestrian Clubs which provided much of the labor for this wonderful facility.</p><h2>Facilities</h2><ul><li>10 campsites</li><li>Drinking water</li><li>Vault toilet</li><li>No garbage disposal - Please pack it out</li></ul>",

The organization operated the trap, keeping it baited with carcasses for six years, but caught only bears. Currently the Forest Service keeps an eye on the trap, but otherwise does not maintain it.

But at night, with the twinkling lights of Grants Pass far in the distance, the rustic cabin becomes an astronomer&rsquo;s heaven as the expansive night&rsquo;s sky is littered with constellations and planets, the moon and the Milky Way. Although the glow from the city of Grants Pass does obscure the northeastern night sky to some degree, little or no light pollution sullies the inky skies in other directions. No trees obscure the view. Sit back and gaze.</p><p>Onion Mountain lookout is at 4,438 feet above sea level and is set atop a 12-foot tower. A visit to the cabin, a 14&rsquo; by 14&rsquo; block of wood and windows, feels like camping in a house of glass. It is furnished with a bed and a table and chairs, and features a propane cooking stove, refrigerator, and lanterns. A vault toilet is located near the tower. There is no water on site, so visitors must bring sufficient supplies for drinking, cooking and washing. There is no propane heater.</p><p><strong>Warning</strong>: Because of the tower, this site is not recommended for families with toddlers or young children.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability:</strong>&nbsp;Onion Mountain Lookout is available for rent from May 27 through Oct 15.</li><li><strong>Price and Capacity:&nbsp;</strong>$40 per night per group, with a maximum of four occupants. The maximum length stay is five consecutive nights. Fees are used directly for the maintenance and preservation of the lookout.</li><li><strong>Reservations:&nbsp;</strong>To make arrangements to pick up and sign the rental permit required, please call Forest Service representatives at 541-471-6724.

The manmade lake, at 2,530 acres, sits on the Jackson River and has 43 miles of wooded shoreline. &nbsp;Coles Point is part of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests which span across Virginia and parts of West Virginia and Kentucky. These forests protect 40 species within mostly Appalachian hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood forests, 60 species of mammals and 200 species of birds.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: An inviting swimming beach within the recreation area lures crowds, and the picnic area has an open field for games like Frisbee and soccer. &nbsp;The park offers boating and fishing for large and smallmouth bass, brown trout, bluegill, crappie, shad, catfish, sunfish and chain pickerel. Two fishing docks, two boat ramps and a swimming beach with a bathhouse are located on-site. The 1-mile Morris Hill Bike Trail is popular among hikers and bikers. The 3-mile Fortney Loop Trail is open to hiking along a path with several switchbacks.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Each shelter can accommodate up to 50 people and 20 vehicles. Eight picnic tables sit on a concrete pad, and several additional tables are scattered around the shelter. Each shelter is also equipped with two large barbecue grills, one electrical outlet, drinking water and flush toilets.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions</strong>: Head downstream on the Jackson River for fly-fishing, canoeing, rafting and kayaking. A half-hour east of the lake is Hot Springs, Virginia, a quaint and small rural resort town.&nbsp;The nearest groceries and gas are located in Covington, ",

The heavy wood doors and wood fascia are made from timber harvested from the nearby forest.</p><p>The cabin is set in a partially shaded area that has black cherry and beech trees, scattered hemlock and clumps of oak, maple and birch. In the nearby Hickory Creek area, there is an understory of abundant wildflowers, ferns, shrubs and mosses. Large white pine can be found scattered in open areas.</p><p>Bears, deer, turkeys, barred owls, and pileated woodpecker are common in the area. Small native brook trout can be found in the Farnsworth Stream, as well as other area creeks and streams, of which there are plenty..</p><p>A dam was also built at the hatchery in the 1930s, to slow and divert water flowing in the stream to the concrete raceways and ponds to provide cold water habitat to raise young trout fingerlings. Although fishing is not permitted in the hatchery ponds or raceways, nearby Farnsworth Stream is stocked and fishing is permitted.</p><p>The Hickory Creek Wilderness Area is just a few miles from the cabin. Chapman Lake in Chapman State Park, which is adjacent to the forest, Allegheny River and Tionesta Creek are also within a short distance of the cabin.

Snow is common from December through March.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Kaibab Lake is a popular area to join friends or family for a picnic in the cool pines. A number of forest attractions are easily accessed from the campground, such as overlooks, dams and hiking trails. A nature trail wanders through the facility.&nbsp;Swimming is not allowed in the lake, but anglers can take to its shores or deeper waters via an accessible fishing pier and small boat ramp.

The vast majority of this alpine area is forested, ranging from stands of ponderosa pine mixed with Gambel Oak at lower altitudes, to alpine spruce and fir near the summit. Much of the steeper parts of Kendrick contain old growth forest that contributes valuable habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, bear, and Northern goshawk. Wildflower covered meadows break the tree cover at a number of places, providing forage for mule deer and elk as well as viewpoints and lunch spots for forest visitors. Kendrick Mountain is one of many remnants of the vast San Francisco Mountain volcanic field that stretches from near Seligman on the west and east beyond Flagstaff to Canyon Diablo.

This rugged desert canyon is so remote and so unique it was one of the first areas in Arizona to be officially designated and protected as wilderness by the U.S. Congress. The upper reaches of Sycamore Canyon lie at the southeastern edge of the Kaibab National Forest. A limited number of forest roads and trails provide access.</p><p>The Sycamore Trail skirts the canyon&#39;s upper reaches and provides a number of jumping off places for further exploration. Although mountain bikes and other vehicles are excluded from the wilderness, the Sycamore Canyon Scenic drive and bike route provides an excellent vantage for enjoying the scenery it holds.

Big Elk Guard Station sits on the fringe of Big Elk Meadow, a grassy expanse that floods to a shallow pond in the spring and dries out in the summer, providing good grazing for a dozen or more horses. Stroll across the meadow, and you can see Mt. McLoughlin (9,495 feet above sea level) and the edge of a 20,000 year old lava flow from Brown Mountain. The surrounding forest, which includes lodgepole pine, quaking aspen, Shasta red fir and Douglas fir, add to the incredible beauty of the site.</p><p>Big Elk Guard Station, a rustic log cabin within a fenced yard, is located just off of Forest Road 37, the main access route through the east side of the beautiful Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest. The fully furnished cabin has two upper-story bunk rooms that are reached by a double landing staircase (the stairway is steep, and young children would require assistance going up and down). The first floor rooms include a large, comfortable living room with a mortared-rock fireplace (firewood is provided), and a well-equipped kitchen with a table and chairs, a dry sink, and an electric range and refrigerator. The original fir flooring remains intact. There are electric lights and heat throughout the cabin.</p><p>No potable water is available on site; visitors must bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing.

A visitor center<br />is located at Jacob Lake, 30 miles south and east of Fredonia at the junction of highways US 89A<br />and AZ 67.&nbsp;</p><p>Major John Wesley Powell, the famous explorer of the Colorado River, was the first in written record to apply the term &ldquo;Kaibab&rdquo; to the plateau. &ldquo;Kaibab&rdquo; is a Paiute Indian word meaning &ldquo;mountain lying down.&rdquo;</p><p>Most of the Kaibab Plateau was withdrawn from the public domain in 1893 as part of the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve. This area included lands on both sides of the Grand Canyon and essentially all of the North Kaibab Ranger District. In 1908, the forest reserve north of the Grand Canyon, including the game preserve, was renamed the Kaibab National Forest. In 1919, Grand Canyon National Park<br />was created from the Forest Service lands surrounding the Grand Canyon.</p><p>In 1934, the Tusayan National Forest south of the Grand Canyon was consolidated into the Kaibab National Forest, forming the present forest boundaries. The forest area north of the Canyon became the North Kaibab<br />Ranger District, one of the three ranger districts of the Kaibab National Forest.</p><p>The Kaibab Plateau is an island of forested lands surrounded by the sage, grasslands and canyons of lower elevations. The plateau, with elevations up to 9,000 feet, is bordered on the south by the Grand Canyon, on the east and west by tributary canyons of the Colorado River, and on the north by plains that are dissected by the tiers of uplifted cliffs of the Grand Staircase.</p>",

Set up a volleyball net or toss a frisbee on the lawn, and later relax beneath the shade of the wide wrap-around porch!</p><p>The two-story house features one room on a lower floor, and a three-quarter dividing wall upstairs. The first floor, porch and surrounding grounds are all accessible. The house is minimally furnished with a table and chairs, a sink and food preparation counter, and a wood stove. Bring your own firewood, propane and battery-powered lanterns. While there is sleeping space for up to 30 visitors, this is a rustic camping experience--there are no beds. Visitors are encouraged to bring camping equipment, including flashlights, cooking and eating utensils, sleeping bags and pads for comfort.</p><p>There is plenty of drinking water on site, available from the bright red hand pump, as well as outdoor picnic tables and a group fire ring. An accessible vault toilet is located near the house.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Mr. Ludlum, an oil-company executive, built a two-story vacation house on this site in 1939. He and his family even lived in the house year-round for a time.&nbsp;However, after&nbsp;World War II, the family sold the property to the Forest Service.</p><p>Like the current building, the original Ludlum House had two stories, but differed from the existing structure in that it did not have a porch that encircled the entire building, and the upstairs had less headroom. In the 1990s, the Forest Service determined that the Ludlum House was far too rotted to restore, and so the original structure was demolished and a new one (a near-replica) was built in 1999.</p><p><iframe allowfu",

An outdoor, barrier-free toilet, picnic table and fire ring are located near the cabin.</p><p>Visitors should bring camping equipment and sleeping bags. There is no electricity or drinking water at the site, so bring a lantern and plenty of water for cooking, drinking and washing.

Elevations range from near 2,000 feet at the river to 6,000 feet at the rim&#39;s edge. The upper reaches serve as a winter range for the Kaibab mule deer. Vegetation is varied and sparse except for heavy riparian growth in the creek bottom. There are few dependable water sources here for man or beast during the summer months when temperatures approach 120 degrees. A number of trails lead into this rather hostile environment but many are poorly marked and infrequently maintained.

The area was once a bustling logging town, established in 1889, with over 600 inhabitants. The town had a large sawmill, shingle mill, broom handle factory and a rail connection for shipping products to Sheffield, PA. Once the timber supply was exhausted in 1913, the mills shut down and the town was deserted.</p><p>The Federal Government purchased the site in 1925, adding it to the newly formed Allegheny National Forest. In the 1930s, the Forest Service (using CCC labor) reconstructed the mill pond, added a bathhouse, swimming area, picnic shelters, and landscaping. The distinctive quality of CCC workmanship is evident today in the dam stonework and the log construction of the old bathhouse. The camping loops were added in the 1960s.</p><p>Trout fishing is good in Millstone Creek. The picturesque <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/allegheny/recarea/?recid=82077\">Clarion River,</a> about four miles south of the campground, offers excellent fishing and canoeing. A three-mile long hiking trail, marked with off-white diamonds, starts and ends at Loleta, from the parking lot near the group camping site through the woods around the upper camping loop and comes back in between the upper loop and the group site. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/allegheny/recarea/?recid=81944\">Buzzard Swamp</a> offers 10 miles of trail, 5 miles North of Loleta Recreation Area.</p><p><em><strong>View/Print Site Brochure - </strong></em><a href=\"https://go.usa.gov/xXC7V\">pdf</a></p>",

The large grassy meadow has a long history of being a major grazing area for horses and cattle, and that tradition continues today. The meadow offers plenty of room on the even terrain for a large group of visitors to spread out, camp, horseback ride, hike, mountain bike or just relax.</p><p>Sitting amongst 40 acres of cross-fenced pastures, Lodgepole Guard Station can easily serve as the base camp for a group of campers and their horses, as well as other large recreation groups. However, while bringing horses and many friends is an option, it&#39;s certainly not a requirement; the appeals of the cabin and area are plentiful for couples and small families.</p><p>The cozy one story, one bedroom cabin offers a large living room with a wood stove and furnished with a log-style couch, chair and coffee table, a bath with flush toilet and hot shower, and propane heat throughout. The kitchen is equipped with a refrigerator, basic cooking utensils, and a cozy dining nook is furnished with a table and chairs. Also on the site are a former bunkhouse, where firewood is stored, and a barn stable with several horse paddocks.</p><h2>History</h2><p>The guard station at Lodgepole Meadow was built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps to be used as a remote guard station for the early Forest Service crews working in the area, and replaced the original guard station that had been built in 1911. During WWII, Herb (in photo at right) and Zella Wright, a husband and wife lookout team, lived throughout the winter high up on the Blue Rock Lookout several miles away watching for enemy aircraft.

By 1881, the Bradford field produced well over 90% of the national petroleum supply.</p><p>Imagine yourself as a pumper inspecting your rod line while the single piston engine drives the rod lines to get power to the pump jack. The mechanical trick here is to transfer the horizontal energy of the rod line to a vertical motion that pulls the sucker rod up and down in the well.</p><p>The rhythmic thumping of the Cooper-Bessemer single piston, 22.5 horsepower oil field engine, the clinking of the rod lines, and the screeching of the belts are now just echoes on the wind, ringing off the scrap metal walls of this 1939 powerhouse that was in use for half a century.</p><p>The pump jack may be one of the most important tools of the oil industry. Without it, oil stays underground, hidden from those who seek its riches.</p><p>Finding the black gold and drilling for it in the late 1800&#39;s was no small task. Four men worked twelve hour shifts for as long as it took with only Sundays off. A Standard Drilling Rig used a 15 to 20 inch diameter log, 12 to 15 feet long as a maul to loosen the earth in the drilling hole. Once the hole was deep enough, an auger (drill bit) replaced or alternated with the maul to deepen the hole. Casing kept the hole open as the bit went deeper and deeper in search of oil. Oil was brought to the surface using the engine in the powerhouse to drive a system of belts, wheels and rod lines.</p><p>Each oil field in the early 1900&#39;s had a different pumping system with its own unique solutions to the engineering problems at hand.

The dam provides flood control and hydro-electric power generation, along with creating Allegheny Reservoir, the second deepest lake in Pennsylvania. While the land around the dam is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, the dam itself is managed by the Army Corps of Engineers.</p><p>The dam was built after a flood in 1936 flooded the Pittsburgh metro area. The flood prompted the creation of the Flood Control Acts of 1936 and 1938 by Congress, which authorized building the dam.</p><p>There was considerable opposition to the dam, the flooding behind the dam forced numerous communities to move and thousands of acres of fertile farmland to be buried underwater. More than 600 families were displaced by the dam, including those in the town of Kinzua and Corydon in Pennsylvania and Onoville and Quaker Bridge, located in New York.</p><p>Nearly one-third of the ceded territory of the Seneca Nation, granted under the Treaty of Canandaigua, signed by President Washington, was condemned from the building of the dam, an area totaling 10,000 acres. The government set aside 305 acres of land for the Seneca resettlement in the New York communities of Steamburg and Jimerson Town, to partially compensate for the loss of the communities.</p><p>The dam also forced the displacement of Camp Olmstead, owned by the Chief Cornplanter Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The campsite was moved up the hillside and now sits on the shoreline of the Allegheny Resevoir where it is still in use by the Chief Cornplanter Council, America&#39;s oldest Boy Scouts council, today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

They flipped a coin to see which man they would name it after, and Hannagan won.</p><p>Toles Cosper&#39;s son, DeWitt Cosper, built a lodge here in 1926.&nbsp;Hannagan Meadow is currently the highest point in Arizona to be inhabited throughout the entire year. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Winter Trails Highlights</strong></p><p>The groomed ski trails at Hannagan Meadow are narrower and generally more challenging than those at Williams Valley.

Old timers called these pines &quot;chin whiskers&quot;. These &quot;chin whiskers&quot; somehow escaped being burned by wildfires that ravaged the area after it was railroad-logged in the early 1900&#39;s. The terrain within the Whisker Lake area ranges from rolling upland to beaver flooded wetlands. Trout fishing is available at Riley Lake, Edith Lake, Wakefield Creek and the Brule River. Berry picking, hunting, cross-country skiing and wildlife viewing are just some of the activities you can enjoy during your visit.</p>",

Weekends bring the most campers, with only moderate use occurring during the week. So come and relax among the pines and enjoy the sound and beauty of Bagley Rapids.</p><p>Nearby is the Mountain Fire Lookout Tower, a popular local tourist destination.&nbsp; This is one of the last fire towers standing on its original location in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest.&nbsp; It was built in 1935 and was one of a series of 20 towers built in the Forest during the 1930s. If you&rsquo;re brave enough, you can climb the tower and enjoy a panoramic view of the surrounding countryside.</p><p>The Jones Spring non-motorized area is nearby, and offers hiking, hunting&nbsp;and cross-country skiing. Also nearby is Cathedral Pines, an area that survived Wisconsin&rsquo;s logging era where the majestic pines and hemlocks have been preserved in their natural state.&nbsp;General use at this popular campground is heavy throughout the summer, mostly on weekends. There are plenty of sites to see on the district and Bagley Rapids Recreation area can serve as a home base.</p><p>So, if you like to swim, fish, hike, picnic then the Bagley Rapids Recreation Area is the place for you, conveniently located just 5 minutes south of Mountain.</p>",

Plenty of open space, shaded forests and mountain scenery make for a pleasant outdoor experience.</p><p><strong>Natural Features: </strong>The campground sits at an elevation of 9,100 ft. in the White Mountains of eastern Arizona. It is a very scenic area, forested with ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, spruce and aspen interspersed with high elevation meadows.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some campsites have shade, while others are mostly sunny. Summer temperatures are pleasant and cool, a nice respite from the heat of lower deserts.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>The Apache Trout facility is a short walk away from the 450-acre Big Lake, one of Arizona&#39;s top fishing lakes. Big Lake is known for its trout fishing, with rainbow, cutthroat, brook and Apache trout being the most sought-after species. The recreation area is also popular for hiking, mountain biking, bird watching and wildlife viewing.</p><p><strong>Facilities: </strong>The campground is especially convenient for small to medium sized groups. Campsites are diverse and offer a wide range of options. There are 22 double sites, one group site that can accommodate 50 people, another that can hold 100 and more than 20 individual sites. There are 41 electrical full hook up sites and 81 non-electrical sites.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the only campground in the lake recreation area that has sites with full hookups.

All group sites are reservable. Six sites are available for small groups up to 16 people and four sites can accommodate large groups up to 30 people in addition to the 89 single family sites.</p><p>The campground has a picnic area, swim beach and boat landing. Fishing is good in the 362 acre Boulder Lake which has walleye, northern pike, bass, and panfish. Several nearby streams offer trout fishing, too. The nearby Wolf River has opportunities for world class white water canoeing, rafting&nbsp;and trout fishing.</p><p>The campground also features a hiking trail. A wooden boardwalk begins your journey into another world of primitive bog vegetation, deer trails, squirrels&#39; nests, and the workings of woodpeckers. Hike up and down the ridges around a large open bog area. The huge boulders you&#39;ll see are the calling cards left behind when the last glacier receded and formed the rugged terrain over 10,000 years ago. Campers can access the trail from several points in the campground.</p><p>If you plan to come on a summer weekend, get an early start! Even though this is the Chequamegon-Nicolet&#39;s largest campground, campsites fill up fast and reservations are encouraged.</p><p>Please note: Services such as showers, water fill stations, RV septic dump and other water-related amenities are shut down for the season at the end of September, depending on weather conditions.</p>",

The first lookout was a one-story log cabin, which is still on the site. The current lookout was built in 1963 and is available for rent for up to four people.</p><p><strong>Natural Features: </strong>The Yaak area is home to grizzly bears, wolves, elk, deer and a variety of smaller mammals and birds. The Yaak River and its many tributaries provide habitat for cutthroat, rainbow, brook and bull trout. There are also several lakes scattered at varying elevations for hikers and fisherman to enjoy.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Garver Creek is located near the lookout and offers opportunities for trout fishing. Day hiking is another popular pastime in the area around the lookout.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: The current lookout is 144 square feet and 40 feet tall. The lookout is equipped with two twin beds with 4 mattresses, a wood stove, table, chairs, shovel bucket and cleaning gear. Due to vandalism, however, these items are not guaranteed.&nbsp; The lookout is not wired for electricity and water sources are limited. There is a pit toilet located outside.&nbsp;Although there are a few amenities provided, guests will need to bring their own supplies such as drinking water, sleeping bags, pillows, toilet paper, matches, food and cooking utensils, to ensure a comfortable stay.</p>",

It is a popular destination for boating, fishing and swimming on Lake Koocanusa, and hiking in the surrounding forest. Beautiful sandstone formations can be viewed not far from the campground, and osprey and eagles can often be seen fishing in the reservoir.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp; </strong>The campground is located on an arm of Lake Koocanusa in northwest Montana near the Canadian border. The 46,500-acre reservoir has over 127 miles of shoreline and is formed by 422&#39; Libby Dam on the Kootenai River, which stretches about 90 miles and into Canada. It is a large campground, situated in a ponderosa pine forest at an elevation of 2,470 feet.&nbsp;Osprey often fish around Libby Dam at sunset, making for enjoyable viewing opportunities. Bald eagles can be seen hunting kokanee in the river and lake during the fall. A variety of wildlife also makes its home in the area.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Fishing, boating and swimming are popular activities. Fishing derbies are held several times each year and anglers can expect a catch of kokanee salmon, whitefish and a variety of trout, among others.&nbsp;A variety of hiking trails begins in the campground, including a relatively short interpretive trail that loops around the campground, and the Hoodoo Trail, that leads to impressive sandstone formations that jut out from an inlet along the lake. The Hoodoos can also be seen via boat. Several paths lead from the campground to the adjacent beach, boat ramp and fish cleaning stations.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>:&nbsp; The campground offers dozens of accessible, single-family sites for tent and RV camping.&nbsp;Nineteen sites are available for reservation on <a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/\">Recreation.gov</a> and the rest are available on a first-come, first-served basis. A large parking area is available for boat trailers and RVs.&nbsp;Each site is equipped with a table and campfire ring w",

The original Gem Peak Lookout was activated in 1921 as a &quot;rag outfit&quot;--a pole platform tent near a 15 foot open-platform tower.&nbsp;Today, the renovated structure includes a 225 square foot cabin atop a 30-foot tower with amenities such as a wood heating stove, single beds and of course, the incredible view of the Clark Fork River and the Noxon area.&nbsp;Full vehicle access depends on weather conditions, but typically visitors can drive straight to the lookout.</p><p><strong>Natural Features: </strong>The Clark Fork River Area is bordered by the Idaho line on the west and the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness on the east. The Clark Fork River flows north and west through the District, and the Bull and Vermilion Rivers join it from the north. Rugged peaks ranging in elevation from 6,000-8,700 feet overlook the valley bottom. The Kootenai National Forest is dominated by a mixed conifer forest, but there is also an impressive ancient cedar grove set aside as a scenic area. In the spring and throughout the summer, a succession of wildflowers add color to hillsides and meadows and in the fall, stands of western larch and aspen mix yellows with the reds of huckleberry bushes, mountain maples and mountain ash.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: The Cabinet Ranger District features almost half a million acres of National Forest lands offering a full range of year-round recreational opportunities. Approximately 400 miles of trail are available to the hiker, hunter, and stock user to access various lakes and scenic viewpoints. 150 miles of these trails are open to motorized use. The District maintains almost 400 miles of open road, and many miles of gated roads offer additional opportunities to mountain bikers, berry pickers, and hunters. There is a trailhead located near the lookout with access for both hiking and OHV riding. For more information on desi",

Take trail #446 past the lookout and enjoy many more miles of scenic views.&nbsp;A day trip to Koocanusa Reservoir offers visitors the option of biking, fishing, hiking or boating around the lake. Trail #90, which starts just off of the Koocanusa Reservoir on Hwy 37, follows McGuire Creek closely for a scenic hike along the water.&nbsp;Because the McGuire Lookout is surrounded by windows on top of one of the area&#39;s tallest summits (almost 7,000 feet), visitors have the best views of the sunrise and sunset over the surrounding cabinet mountains.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: The lookout is a 12 x 12 foot wood-frame cabin with a pyramidal-shaped roof.
