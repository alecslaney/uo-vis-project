The manmade lake, at 2,530 acres, sits on the Jackson River and has 43 miles of wooded shoreline. &nbsp;Coles Point is part of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests which span across Virginia and parts of West Virginia and Kentucky. These forests protect 40 species within mostly Appalachian hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood forests, 60 species of mammals and 200 species of birds.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: An inviting swimming beach within the recreation area lures crowds, and the picnic area has an open field for games like Frisbee and soccer. &nbsp;The park offers boating and fishing for large and smallmouth bass, brown trout, bluegill, crappie, shad, catfish, sunfish and chain pickerel. Two fishing docks, two boat ramps and a swimming beach with a bathhouse are located on-site. The 1-mile Morris Hill Bike Trail is popular among hikers and bikers. The 3-mile Fortney Loop Trail is open to hiking along a path with several switchbacks.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Each shelter can accommodate up to 50 people and 20 vehicles. Eight picnic tables sit on a concrete pad, and several additional tables are scattered around the shelter. Each shelter is also equipped with two large barbecue grills, one electrical outlet, drinking water and flush toilets.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions</strong>: Head downstream on the Jackson River for fly-fishing, canoeing, rafting and kayaking. A half-hour east of the lake is Hot Springs, Virginia, a quaint and small rural resort town.&nbsp;The nearest groceries and gas are located in Covington, ",

By 1881, the Bradford field produced well over 90% of the national petroleum supply.</p><p>Imagine yourself as a pumper inspecting your rod line while the single piston engine drives the rod lines to get power to the pump jack. The mechanical trick here is to transfer the horizontal energy of the rod line to a vertical motion that pulls the sucker rod up and down in the well.</p><p>The rhythmic thumping of the Cooper-Bessemer single piston, 22.5 horsepower oil field engine, the clinking of the rod lines, and the screeching of the belts are now just echoes on the wind, ringing off the scrap metal walls of this 1939 powerhouse that was in use for half a century.</p><p>The pump jack may be one of the most important tools of the oil industry. Without it, oil stays underground, hidden from those who seek its riches.</p><p>Finding the black gold and drilling for it in the late 1800&#39;s was no small task. Four men worked twelve hour shifts for as long as it took with only Sundays off. A Standard Drilling Rig used a 15 to 20 inch diameter log, 12 to 15 feet long as a maul to loosen the earth in the drilling hole. Once the hole was deep enough, an auger (drill bit) replaced or alternated with the maul to deepen the hole. Casing kept the hole open as the bit went deeper and deeper in search of oil. Oil was brought to the surface using the engine in the powerhouse to drive a system of belts, wheels and rod lines.</p><p>Each oil field in the early 1900&#39;s had a different pumping system with its own unique solutions to the engineering problems at hand. No two looked or ran quite",

Located near the Kinzua Dam, and across from Longhouse National Scenic Byway, the information center faces the location of the former town on Kinzua.</p><p>The Kinzua Dam is one of the largest dams east of the Mississippi River. The dam provides flood control and hydro-electric power generation, along with creating Allegheny Reservoir, the second deepest lake in Pennsylvania. While the land around the dam is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, the dam itself is managed by the Army Corps of Engineers.</p><p>The dam was built after a flood in 1936 flooded the Pittsburgh metro area. The flood prompted the creation of the Flood Control Acts of 1936 and 1938 by Congress, which authorized building the dam.</p><p>There was considerable opposition to the dam, the flooding behind the dam forced numerous communities to move and thousands of acres of fertile farmland to be buried underwater. More than 600 families were displaced by the dam, including those in the town of Kinzua and Corydon in Pennsylvania and Onoville and Quaker Bridge, located in New York.</p><p>Nearly one-third of the ceded territory of the Seneca Nation, granted under the Treaty of Canandaigua, signed by President Washington, was condemned from the building of the dam, an area totaling 10,000 acres. The government set aside 305 acres of land for the Seneca resettlement in the New York communities of Steamburg and Jimerson Town, to partially compensate for the loss of the communities.</p><p>The dam also forced the displacement of Camp Olmstead, owned by the Chief Cornplanter Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The campsite was moved up the hillside and now sits on the shoreline of the Allegheny Resevoir where it is still in use by the Chief Cornplanter Council, America&#39;s oldest Boy Scouts council, today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The lake is a popular spot for fishing and picnicking, as well as for RV and motorhome campers. With Grand Canyon National Park just 60 miles north and several other cultural and historic sites nearby, the location is a hotspot for recreation, learning and sightseeing.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>Kaibab National Forest is nestled on the Colorado Plateau, on an area of land that was uplifted by geologic processes. The lake sits at an elevation of 6,800 feet, and pine forests and grass line its shores, while wildflowers add extra color to the landscape in late spring and early summer. Summer temperatures range from 50 degrees at night to 80-90 degrees during the day. Summer thunderstorms, known as the monsoon, can build up quickly, especially during July and August. Snow is common from December through March.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Kaibab Lake is a popular area to join friends or family for a picnic in the cool pines. A number of forest attractions are easily accessed from the campground, such as overlooks, dams and hiking trails. A nature trail wanders through the facility.&nbsp;Swimming is not allowed in the lake, but anglers can take to its shores or deeper waters via an accessible fishing pier and small boat ramp. On clear nights, campers can turn their eyes to the night sky to enjoy spectacular views of summer stars.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: The campground offers individual, double and group campsites with picnic tables and campfire rings. Tents, trailers and motorhomes up to 40 feet can be accommodated.&nbsp;Campers have the convenience of a group picnic area, restrooms, trash bins and water faucets. Drinking water is provided, however motor homes and RV water tanks cannot be filled due to limited water supply. Firewood bundles, ice, bait and ice cream are can be purchased on-site.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions:&nbsp;</strong>Grand Canyon National Park&#39;s South Rim is ab",

The vast majority of this alpine area is forested, ranging from stands of ponderosa pine mixed with Gambel Oak at lower altitudes, to alpine spruce and fir near the summit. Much of the steeper parts of Kendrick contain old growth forest that contributes valuable habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, bear, and Northern goshawk. Wildflower covered meadows break the tree cover at a number of places, providing forage for mule deer and elk as well as viewpoints and lunch spots for forest visitors. Kendrick Mountain is one of many remnants of the vast San Francisco Mountain volcanic field that stretches from near Seligman on the west and east beyond Flagstaff to Canyon Diablo. Three hiking trails offer access to the wilderness.</p>",

Sycamore Canyon cuts through the Mogollon Rim, then drops off the Colorado Plateau with an unmatched flourish of red rock buttes and sheer cliffs. It winds for 20 miles along Sycamore Creek and at places stretches 7 miles from rim to rim.</p><p>Wind and water have exposed 7 geological associations of plants and animals set in a spectacular setting of red sandstone, white limestone, and brown lava. This rugged desert canyon is so remote and so unique it was one of the first areas in Arizona to be officially designated and protected as wilderness by the U.S. Congress. The upper reaches of Sycamore Canyon lie at the southeastern edge of the Kaibab National Forest. A limited number of forest roads and trails provide access.</p><p>The Sycamore Trail skirts the canyon&#39;s upper reaches and provides a number of jumping off places for further exploration. Although mountain bikes and other vehicles are excluded from the wilderness, the Sycamore Canyon Scenic drive and bike route provides an excellent vantage for enjoying the scenery it holds. Additional routes into the area are available from the Coconino National Forest.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaibabnationalforest/sets/72157637678408436/\">Landscapes&quot; Images Album</a></p>",

The district encompasses most of<br />the Kaibab Plateau, with the&nbsp;southern boundary bordering Grand Canyon National Park. A visitor center<br />is located at Jacob Lake, 30 miles south and east of Fredonia at the junction of highways US 89A<br />and AZ 67.&nbsp;</p><p>Major John Wesley Powell, the famous explorer of the Colorado River, was the first in written record to apply the term &ldquo;Kaibab&rdquo; to the plateau. &ldquo;Kaibab&rdquo; is a Paiute Indian word meaning &ldquo;mountain lying down.&rdquo;</p><p>Most of the Kaibab Plateau was withdrawn from the public domain in 1893 as part of the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve. This area included lands on both sides of the Grand Canyon and essentially all of the North Kaibab Ranger District. In 1908, the forest reserve north of the Grand Canyon, including the game preserve, was renamed the Kaibab National Forest. In 1919, Grand Canyon National Park<br />was created from the Forest Service lands surrounding the Grand Canyon.</p><p>In 1934, the Tusayan National Forest south of the Grand Canyon was consolidated into the Kaibab National Forest, forming the present forest boundaries. The forest area north of the Canyon became the North Kaibab<br />Ranger District, one of the three ranger districts of the Kaibab National Forest.</p><p>The Kaibab Plateau is an island of forested lands surrounded by the sage, grasslands and canyons of lower elevations. The plateau, with elevations up to 9,000 feet, is bordered on the south by the Grand Canyon, on the east and west by tributary canyons of the Colorado River, and on the north by plains that are dissected by the tiers of uplifted cliffs of the Grand Staircase.</p>",

The pavilion has also been known to host a birds nest or two.</p><p>The beach is formed of concrete with fine pea gravel used in place of sand, and is approximately 450 feet in length and extends out into the water to a depth of at least 8 feet. This is necessary due to the age of the reservoir, which was built in 1965, meaning that there has not been enough time for natural beaches to form.</p><p>The beach is a trailhead for <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/allegheny/recarea/?recid=75413\">Rimrock Overlook and Hiking Trail</a>.</p>",

Elevations range from near 2,000 feet at the river to 6,000 feet at the rim&#39;s edge. The upper reaches serve as a winter range for the Kaibab mule deer. Vegetation is varied and sparse except for heavy riparian growth in the creek bottom. There are few dependable water sources here for man or beast during the summer months when temperatures approach 120 degrees. A number of trails lead into this rather hostile environment but many are poorly marked and infrequently maintained. Limited and arduous access to the Kanab Creek area adds a measure of remoteness that says this is truly wilderness.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5196881.pdf\">Kanab Creek Wilderness Access Map</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaibabnationalforest/sets/72157637678408436/\">&quot;Landscapes&quot; Images Album</a></p>",

The area was once a bustling logging town, established in 1889, with over 600 inhabitants. The town had a large sawmill, shingle mill, broom handle factory and a rail connection for shipping products to Sheffield, PA. Once the timber supply was exhausted in 1913, the mills shut down and the town was deserted.</p><p>The Federal Government purchased the site in 1925, adding it to the newly formed Allegheny National Forest. In the 1930s, the Forest Service (using CCC labor) reconstructed the mill pond, added a bathhouse, swimming area, picnic shelters, and landscaping. The distinctive quality of CCC workmanship is evident today in the dam stonework and the log construction of the old bathhouse. The camping loops were added in the 1960s.</p><p>Trout fishing is good in Millstone Creek. The picturesque <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/allegheny/recarea/?recid=82077\">Clarion River,</a> about four miles south of the campground, offers excellent fishing and canoeing. A three-mile long hiking trail, marked with off-white diamonds, starts and ends at Loleta, from the parking lot near the group camping site through the woods around the upper camping loop and comes back in between the upper loop and the group site. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/allegheny/recarea/?recid=81944\">Buzzard Swamp</a> offers 10 miles of trail, 5 miles North of Loleta Recreation Area.</p><p><em><strong>View/Print Site Brochure - </strong></em><a href=\"https://go.usa.gov/xXC7V\">pdf</a></p>",

Along the length of the area, through a blanket of pine, fir, and spruce, Bear Wallow Creek flows year-round and is shaded by green riparian hardwoods during summer. The creek provides a habitat for the endangered Apache trout; anglers can try for other species in the creek and its north and south forks. Early explorers were impressed by the large number of well-used wallows, which revealed how plentiful the area&#39;s population of black bears was. Black bears still abound, and you may see elk, deer, and a diverse community of smaller mammals, birds, and reptiles. Wildflowers bloom in profusion, especially during the summer rains. Poison ivy is present and can be dangerously abundant in places.</p><p>Five trails offer foot and horse access to Bear Wallow.

Big Lake itself is 575 acres, and makes a convenient base for other local lakes like Crescent Lake, Lee Valley Lake and the East and West Forks of the Black River. Choose your site from one of nine campgrounds and experience exceptional hiking and mountain biking trails, wildlife viewing, and trout fishing. Campers have the convenience of paved roads, a dump station and showers, but no electric hookups. Apache Trout, the largest campground can accomodate RVs (max 45 feet) as well as in sections of Grayling Campground. Two campgrounds give tent campers the entire campground all to themselves. A visitor center and naturalist programs offer plenty of knowledge about the area.&nbsp;</span></p>",
