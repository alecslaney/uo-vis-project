Continue straight on the Daisy Pass Trail which follows the curve of the basin and leads southwest of Garfield Peak, which will be immediately in front of you. The next quarter mile is a steep ascent, with incredible views of Democrat Basin, Purple Peak, Aftly Peak and Blue Lake. The trail then descends into Peeler Basin. Garfield and Peeler Peaks form the high points on the ridge to the north. Scarp Ridge, with several points above 12,000 feet, forms the south side of the basin. Traveling east, the trail loses its steepness and begins to follow a small stream. Approximately one half mile east of Peeler Lakes the trail forks again when it intersects the Daisy Pass Peeler Trail #404.5A. The Daisy Pass Trail stays to the right and crosses out of the wilderness area after about 1.4 miles.

This large, nearly level area consists primarily of a poorly drained to very poorly drained freshwater swamp of cypress and gum. The surface is a thick, spongy mat of organic material, sluggishly cut by a few shallow sloughs. Longleaf and slash pine flatwoods with a dense understory of saw palmetto, gallberry, and bay form the perimeter of the swamp. Loggers made off with most of the original timber between 1915 and 1920, and earthen railroad trams, some of which are still visible, penetrated the interior. Over time, all signs of human intrusion into the swamp have greatly subsided. However, you might find remnants of naval stores or &ldquo;turpentining&rdquo; operations that began in the area in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A designated hiking trail makes a loop through the drier pine flatwoods of the perimeter on the west-northwestern side.</p><p>Boggy terrain, dense vegetation, insects, and warm, humid conditions make travel here extremely challenging - exacerbated by the fact that the trails are not maintained (your best bet is to follow one of the many old logging roads). Deer hunters are the most common visitors. On the northwest side, an old road tunnels through a stand of massive live oaks that tower overhead.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r4-u13cAuxk?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

After passing through the rocky depths of the canyon, the trail climbs the Devil&rsquo;s Staircase to emerge on easier terrain. Several more miles of gradual climbing through aspen forests, groves of gambel oak and open parks bring you up to the flanks of the Ruby Range and then on to Horse Ranch Park. The Dark Canyon Trail #830 is popular and well maintained, it is the major route across the southern portion of the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gmug/recarea/?recid=80857\">Raggeds Wilderness</a>, but it is rocky in the canyon with occasional wet spots. Three narrow foot bridges cross the creek which becomes a raging river in the spring. The trail is good above the Devil&rsquo;s Staircase, which is a series of switchbacks and not as bad as the name implies. Bands of sheep summer in the upper area. Dark Canyon is typically accessible by early May, but be prepared for ticks and fallen trees blocking the trail.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd548221.pdf\">Geo-Ref Trail Map&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5441230\">Geo-Reference Instructions</a></p>",

The first mile or so of the trail is open to horseback and mountain bikes, but soon becomes impassable to all but foot traffic.&nbsp; It is an old road that has been washed out in spots and covered over by mud and rock slides in other places. This has left the trail in a bad state of repair with sections that are nearly impossible for horse traffic and so horses are not recommended. The north end of the trail ends at private land.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd550887.pdf\">Geo-Ref Trail Map</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5441230\">Geo-Reference Instructions</a></p>",

After crossing Coal Creek, the trail begins to climb and intersects the Green Lake Trail #566 in about 1.8 miles. Continue straight to stay on the Carbon Trail, however a nice downhill is available by turning east and following the Green Lake Trail back to Crested Butte. The Carbon Trail can be fairly rocky and loose as you ascend to an elevation of 10,600 feet. After about 5.1 miles it turns west and begins its descent and comes to an end at FSR 730.1B after another 3.7 miles.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd587574.pdf\">Geo-Ref Trail Map</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5441230\">Geo-Reference Instructions</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The most important thing you can bring to the river is an attitude of cooperation and consideration for wildlife and other river users.

This is an extremely crowded and sought after section of the Snake River due to the great variety in boating challenges, fishing opportunities and beautiful scenery.

Mostly composed of granite uplifts from deep within the earth over 1 billion years ago, these granite monoliths were uplifted and carved by glaciers 500,000 years ago to form circular valley cirques. The Wind River Range is not only one of the oldest mountain ranges in North America, but has the most extensive glacial network in the lower 48 states. Elevations range from 8,000 feet at Green River Lakes to 13,804 feet at Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in the middle Rocky Mountains.</p><p>The Green River Lakes are considered the headwaters of the Green River; the chief tributary to the Colorado River. The Green River runs 730 miles through Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and eventually terminates in northern Mexico.They are also the starting point for many backpacking trails including the northern entrance to the frequently used Highline Trail, which extends along most of the Wind River Range and follows the spine of the Continental Divide south to Big Sandy Opening.</p><p>Hiking the Highline Trail:</p><p>Visitors have a view of the much-photographed large-granite monolith, Squaretop Mountain (11,695 feet) from the Green River Lakes. The mountain looms over pristine blue-green lakes. You can expect to view glimpses of large game animals such as moose, elk, deer, and prong",

Several large informational panels provide historical accounts and pictures of the landslide, which are the only facilities located on site. Dispersed and fee camping, as well as bathrooms are located nearby. Parking area is large enough for trailer turnaround. No cellular service available.</p><p>On June 23, 1925, hurling down the slope at 50 mph, the mile-wide Gros Ventre Slide carried 50,000,000 cubic yards of debris down the mountain and then another 300 feet up the opposite slope. The Slide blocked the Gros Ventre River, and formed a five-mile long body of water known today as Lower Slide Lake.</p><p>Today the Gros Ventre Slide is a large geologic scar marking the north side of Sheep Mountain and can be seen from miles around. At the site of the Gros Ventre Slide there is an interpretive trail that winds through the jumble of debris and new growth that resulted from the Slide. Interpretive signs at the turnout describe this historic geological event, providing insight into how such a powerful land movement occurred. Geologically speaking, the mountains in this area are relatively young and still quite active. Earthquakes can be felt year-round as evidenced by many smaller slumps present throughout the Gros Ventre Corridor, but none yet as dramatic as the Gros Ventre Slide.</p><p>Learn more about the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5340454.pdf\">history behind the Gros Ventre Slide Geological Site</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

This is the main access to the North Fork of Fall Creek Trail #4008, which is a rough, non-motorized trail leading visitors along the creek and up to the Snake River Divide. This area is popular mainly during hunting season. No facilities exist on site although dispersed camping is available. No existing signage. No cellular service available.
