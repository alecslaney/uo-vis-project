The American Forks Campground is nestled in an old-growth forest of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and a cedar under story with grassy areas, ferns, and mosses. With the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas nearby, the location is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, elk, porcupine, native fish, and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the northern spotted owl, gray wolves, and grizzly bears also find havens in local ecosystems. Summer temperatures are generally sunny and warm with little precipitation, and winters boast mostly clear skies, but plenty of snow.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>The campground setting provides ready access to Bumping Lake, where boating and fishing are popular. Hiking and horseback riding trails extend into the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas, and off-road vehicle and snowmobile access draws visitors to the Little Naches drainage. In winter, snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing are popular in the American River area. The cabin is also conveniently located 30 minutes below the summit of Chinook Pass and Mt. Rainer National Park. A trip along the scenic Mather Parkway is a fantastic outing. The American River, adjacent to the campground, offers a scenic backdrop for anglers. Its cold, clear waters sustain populations of rainbow and brown trout. Whitewater enthusiasts may enjoy a paddle on the river or one of the many other tributaries draining into the Cascade region.</p><p><strong>Facilities: </strong>The campground has 8 reservable sites and 4 first-come, first-served sites between Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend.

The Halfway Flat Campground is nestled in an old-growth forest of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and a cedar under story with grassy areas, ferns and mosses. With the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas nearby, the location is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, elk, porcupine, native fish and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the Northern Spotted Owl, gray wolves, and grizzly bears also find havens in local ecosystems.<br /><br />Summer temperatures are generally sunny and warm with little precipitation, and winters boast mostly clear skies, but plenty of snow.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: The campground setting provides ready access to Naches River, where fishing is popular. Hiking and horseback riding trails extend into the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas, and off-road vehicle and snowmobile access draws visitors to the Little Naches drainage.&nbsp;<br /><br />In winter, snowmobiling is popular in the Little Naches Drainage. Halfway Flat Campground is conveniently located 30 minutes below the summit of Chinook Pass and Mt. Rainer National Park. A trip along the scenic Mather Parkway is a fantastic outing. The Naches River, adjacent to the campground offers a scenic backdrop for anglers. Its cold, clear waters sustain populations of rainbow and brown trout. Whitewater enthusiasts may enjoy a paddle on the river or one of the many other tributaries draining the Cascade region.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: The campground has five campsites available for advanced reservation between Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend. After, mid-September sites will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Vault toil",

After passing through the rocky depths of the canyon, the trail climbs the Devil&rsquo;s Staircase to emerge on easier terrain. Several more miles of gradual climbing through aspen forests, groves of gambel oak and open parks bring you up to the flanks of the Ruby Range and then on to Horse Ranch Park. The Dark Canyon Trail #830 is popular and well maintained, it is the major route across the southern portion of the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gmug/recarea/?recid=80857\">Raggeds Wilderness</a>, but it is rocky in the canyon with occasional wet spots. Three narrow foot bridges cross the creek which becomes a raging river in the spring. The trail is good above the Devil&rsquo;s Staircase, which is a series of switchbacks and not as bad as the name implies. Bands of sheep summer in the upper area. Dark Canyon is typically accessible by early May, but be prepared for ticks and fallen trees blocking the trail.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd548221.pdf\">Geo-Ref Trail Map&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gmug/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5441230\">Geo-Reference Instructions</a></p>",

The trail climbs through dense aspen trees and scattered oak brush, crossing Deep Creek (dangerous in late spring) to Williams Creek Reservoir. From here, the route is a gradual ascent and descent until it climbs steeply out of Buck Creek and follows roads through private land.&nbsp; The Raggeds Trail #820 is little used for its entire length, with the heaviest use on the southern portion from fishermen and day hikers into Williams Creek and Tomahawk reservoirs. Good views of the Raggeds, Buck Basin and Chair Mountain exist along the upper portion of the route. There are over 20 sources of water along the way. Dispersed camping is prevalent everywhere. The major problem exists while crossing 2 miles of private property on roads which can be confusing.

Continue straight on the Daisy Pass Trail which follows the curve of the basin and leads southwest of Garfield Peak, which will be immediately in front of you. The next quarter mile is a steep ascent, with incredible views of Democrat Basin, Purple Peak, Aftly Peak and Blue Lake. The trail then descends into Peeler Basin. Garfield and Peeler Peaks form the high points on the ridge to the north. Scarp Ridge, with several points above 12,000 feet, forms the south side of the basin. Traveling east, the trail loses its steepness and begins to follow a small stream. Approximately one half mile east of Peeler Lakes the trail forks again when it intersects the Daisy Pass Peeler Trail #404.5A. The Daisy Pass Trail stays to the right and crosses out of the wilderness area after about 1.4 miles.

Vegetation is predominantly thick chaparral with forests of ponderosa pine occupying high ridges. A stand of Douglas-fir grows on the sheltered north slope of Cottonwood Peak, the highest in the range. The granite cliffs, buttes and ridges of the Santa Teresas lend themselves to the weathering forces of nature in such a way that, in many places, they have been sculpted into strikingly picturesque formations. These natural works of art give the Santa Teresa Wilderness an unmistakable character. Because of this area&rsquo;s remote nature, it serves as ideal habitat for wildlife species that prefer a high degree of isolation. Among those are black bear and mountain lion. Other desert species, such as mule deer, coatimundi and javelina, can be found here as well.

Once you get to this out-of-the-way recreation spot, one of the first things you&rsquo;ll notice is that the only facilities provided are a toilet and a primitive boat ramp. For some people that&rsquo;s not enough, and they usually turn around and leave. Those drawn to areas that are more primitive and less crowded, however, will choose to stay. Those who do stay will find that this 90-acre impoundment built by the Arizona Game and Fish Department is a good place to go fishing or birdwatching, to take a lakeside stroll or just plain sit back and relax. If you&rsquo;ve brought along your fishing gear, you can try your luck for largemouth bass, catfish or blue gill. Boats powered by single electric trolling motors are permitted on the lake. They make a pleasant way to explore the narrow inlets that branch off the main body of water. Arivaca Lake is located in an area of rolling grasslands set against a backdrop of rocky bluffs and distant mountains. This area is home to a number of cattle ranches, and much of the land in the vicinity of the lake is private property. Take that into consideration if you go strolling across the landscape. No garbage services are provided to this area, so even if you bag your trash neatly before you drive off and leave it, you&rsquo;re littering. Pack out everything that you pack in.</p>",

To help you become better acquainted with this unusual environment, the Stronghold Nature Trail follows a 0.4 mile barrier-free loop that wanders among the yucca, cactus and rocks. This short, easy stroll provides a self-guided introduction to a number of desert plants as well as some of the principles of desert ecology. It also provides good views of the rocks that form the ramparts of the Stronghold. A barrier-free history trail in the campground tells of the area&rsquo;s colorful past. If you would like to retrace the steps of this area&rsquo;s historic residents even deeper into their nearly impenetrable refuge, you may choose to follow the Cochise Trail past dozens of fantastic rock formations as it makes its way across the Dragoons to West Stronghold Canyon and the Council Rocks historic area.

The 76,317-acre Galiuro Wilderness encompasses the mid to upper slopes of the mountains as they rise from golden grasslands, through dense thickets of evergreen oak, to stands of ponderosa pine. Douglas-fir and bigtooth maple inhabit cooler sheltered areas and a stand of aspen cloaks the northern slope of 7,671-foot Bassett Peak, the highest in the range. Two major canyons, Rattlesnake and Redfield, and twin ridges running northeast to southwest form the dominant geologic features of the area. A trail runs along each of these ridges providing access to a variety of connecting trails and spurs. The Galiuros are rich in both natural and cultural history. Wolves roamed these mountains until the mid-1950&rsquo;s. And black bear and mountain lion are still plentiful today.

The remains of a mill foundation can still be seen at the bottom of Onyx Hill. In the 1940&#39;s and 1950&#39;s, the cave became a favorite spot for adventurous people to explore. Increased use led to heavy vandalism. Broken formations and paint-scarred walls became the rule, not the exception. In 1963, the entrance was gated in an effort to preserve the remaining beauty of the cave. The gate was dynamited after a very short time, and no further efforts were made to save the cave until Escabrosa Grotto, Inc., leased Onyx and gated the entrance in 1974. Since that time, several large-scale cleanup and repair projects and numerous one day efforts have restored much of the cave&#39;s former beauty.</p>",

For those who like to fish, Parker Canyon Lake offers both cold and warm water species, including stocked rainbow trout and resident bass, sunfish, and catfish. To make landing those wily lunkers a bit easier, there is a fishing pier and a paved boat ramp at the lake, as well as a lakeside paved area and a graveled path along some of the best catfishing shoreline. There is also a concessionaire-operated country store at the lakeshore where you can pick up some last minute supplies, buy a fishing license, or rent a boat. Bird watchers and just plain nature lovers will also find much to enjoy at Parker Canyon Lake. A five mile trail leads around the shoreline never getting more than a few steps from the water. The Parker Lakeshore Trail offers excellent vantage points from which to enjoy the ducks and other waterfowl that are invariably bobbing on the lake&rsquo;s clear waters. Some of those points even have benches and interpretive signs. Bald eagles and osprey are regularly sighted in this area, as are spring warblers and hummingbirds in season. On the terrestrial side, Coues whitetail deer can frequently be seen browsing among the oaks and grasses that surround the lake and in the two campgrounds near its shores. Coatimundi, javelina, and roadrunners, three animals that are about as southwestern as you can get, make occasional appearances as well.

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>The name &ldquo;Noon Creek&rdquo; comes from the fact that when pioneer settlers traveled this way on excursions into the Pinale&ntilde;o Mountains, this was usually as far as they were able to get via horse and wagon by lunch time of the first day. Noon Creek thus became a traditional lunch stop along the historic travel route into the Pinale&ntilde;os and it remains a popular picnic spot today. The surroundings here are typical of mountain oak woodlands with junipers and scrub oaks standing as the tallest trees, while satin barked manzanita, saw-leafed sotol and soaptree yucca form a picturesque understory. As you enjoy your favorite picnic dish in this setting, keep an eye out for some of the local residents. You may catch a glimpse of a spiny lizard or a raspy-voiced cactus wren, a bird well adapted to life in this dry, bristling environment. Even if you don&rsquo;t see the latter, you can usually hear their raspy call. Watch for roadrunners, too, as they dart among the underbrush always on the lookout for a slithery meal.</p><p>Bear Warning: To avoid putting a bear&rsquo;s life in danger and risking the loss of some of your own property as well, please dispose of all garbage in the bear-proof containers provided. Also remember to keep all food out of reach and out of sight of these curious, powerful animals. Watch for poison ivy and snakes along the streambed of nearby Noon Creek. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coronado/recarea/?recid=25556\">Ladybug</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coronado/recarea/?recid=25562\">Round the Mountain Trails </a>are nearby.</p>",

Tables and charcoal grills here are tucked under mesquite and oak trees a short distance from Madera Creek. In addition to the single table sites, facilities include a large ramada for group get-togethers . Wildlife watching is at the top of the menu at Whitehouse. The Madera Nature Trail, portions of which are paved and barrier free, lead from the picnic area into a nearby mesquite and oak woodland and sycamore-shaded riparian area. This trail actually stretches from Proctor Trailhead, a short distance down-canyon from Whitehouse Picnic Area, to Roundup Picnic Area at the end of the Madera Canyon Road. Since it was built a bit at a time, tread surface and interpretive features vary along its length. Coues white-tailed deer regularly browse within sight of it, barely taking notice of the presence of nature lovers focusing binoculars and clicking cameras just a few feet away. An overlook of Madera Creek provides opportunities to view more secretive species such as javelina and coatimundi as they stop for a drink. Along the two paved loops of the trail, which the Green Valley Hiking Club helped construct, there are interpretive signs in English and Spanish pointing out historic sites and other points of interest. Trailside wooden benches provide opportunities for more leisurely contemplation. Trails, trailhead information stations and interpretive signs along the Madera Nature Trail are maintained by the Friends of Madera Canyon, a hard working group of volunteers dedicated to keeping this area as clean and inviting as possible.</p>",

If you like to fish, you&rsquo;ll be interested to know that the lake holds bass, catfish, crappie and sunfish. During the cool months of the year it is stocked with trout. If you like to birdwatch, this is a good place to do that, too. It offers a number of species of hummingbirds and warblers (in season), in addition to a variety of waterfowl. If picturesque scenery is what you&rsquo;re after, that&rsquo;s provided by the bluffs and mountains that surround the lake. Tables at Red Rock are a short walk downhill from the parking area, so be sure you don&rsquo;t pack in anything you don&rsquo;t want to pack out. No garbage service is provided.</p>",

Upper Thumb Rock is situated on a low hill overlooking this 49-acre body of water that provides year-round fishing for bass, catfish, bluegill and sunfish, and in cooler weather, for stocked trout. Lower Thumb Rock is located along a seasonal stream that flows into the lake at the base of the hill topped by Upper Thumb Rock. Both of these picnic areas have tables sheltered by ramadas and both have their own restrooms. A set of stone steps leads down to the shore from Upper Thumb Rock, which is the more open of the two areas. Lower Thumb Rock is more sheltered than its hilltop neighbor and provides access to the lake via a short trail that is barrier-free. The public boat launching ramp is only a short distance away as well. Though these two lakeside picnic areas are open year-round, the 4,000 foot elevation of the area means the weather can be quite cool here during the winter and early spring. That may come as a surprise since the Mexican Border is only a few miles away. But cool weather makes the trout fishing better, and since the area is so much less crowded when it is cool, that may be the best time to visit.</p>",

This large, nearly level area consists primarily of a poorly drained to very poorly drained freshwater swamp of cypress and gum. The surface is a thick, spongy mat of organic material, sluggishly cut by a few shallow sloughs. Longleaf and slash pine flatwoods with a dense understory of saw palmetto, gallberry, and bay form the perimeter of the swamp. Loggers made off with most of the original timber between 1915 and 1920, and earthen railroad trams, some of which are still visible, penetrated the interior. Over time, all signs of human intrusion into the swamp have greatly subsided. However, you might find remnants of naval stores or &ldquo;turpentining&rdquo; operations that began in the area in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A designated hiking trail makes a loop through the drier pine flatwoods of the perimeter on the west-northwestern side.</p><p>Boggy terrain, dense vegetation, insects, and warm, humid conditions make travel here extremely challenging - exacerbated by the fact that the trails are not maintained (your best bet is to follow one of the many old logging roads). Deer hunters are the most common visitors. On the northwest side, an old road tunnels through a stand of massive live oaks that tower overhead.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r4-u13cAuxk?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",
