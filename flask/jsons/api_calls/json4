The lake is one of two exceptional trout lakes nestled in the caldera of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument, the largest ice-age volcano in Oregon. In addition to fishing for kokanee, rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, chub, and brown trout, people come to this lake to picnic and camp. East Lake shares this outstanding geologic area with Paulina Lake and both lakes are well known for their large brown trout. East lake is one of the finest and most traditional fisheries in Oregon, regularly producing brown trout over 10 pounds. The lake record for brown trout is a 22.5 pounds. Brown. Rainbow trout are also popular using all kinds of angling techniques. East Lake is 6,381 feet above sea level, is approximately a mile in diameter, and the average depth is just over 67 feet. The lake is fed by snowmelt and underground springs.</p><p>Covering over 500 square miles, Newberry Volcano is one of the largest shield volcanoes in the lower 48 states. The area was named after J. S. Newberry, a scientist attached to the 1853 railroad surveying party. The volcano&#39;s summit contains a seventeen square mile caldera, also referred to as Newberry Crater, formed as the top of the volcano collapsed when the magma chamber beneath emptied out. The caldera may have Originally contained one large lake, like Crater Lake. However, more recent eruptions divided the crater into two crystal clear lakes, separated by pumice, ash, and lava flows.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38348\">East Lake Boating Site</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fs.usda.gov/r",

In addition to fishing for kokanee, lake trout, rainbow and brown trout, people come to this lake for sailing, swimming, water skiing windsurfing and camping. Lake trout are caught here in the 5 to 10 pound range with an occasional 20 pounder. In 1993 a 30 pound lake trout was caught at Crescent Lake.</p><p>Crescent Lake is on the Deschutes National Forest in a naturally glaciated basin behind a moraine dam and lies just east of the summit of the Cascade Mountain Range in Northern Klamath County. It is located about 3 miles south of Hwy 58 via Deschutes National Forest Road 60 from Crescent Lake junction. In 1922, a small earth and wooding dam was built across the outlet to store water for irrigation in Bend via Crescent Creek, Little Deschutes and Deschutes Rivers. The Bureau of Reclamation constructed a 40 foot-high earth and concrete in 1956 bringing the lake&rsquo;s surface area elevation at full pool to 4,847 feet where it has a surface area of 4,008 acres. Water is drawn off for irrigation throughout the summer, so by summers end the lake level could drop as much as 15 feet.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/39062\">Crescent Lake Boating Site</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/39104\">Spring Boating Site&nbsp;</a>, and Crescent Lake Lodge.</p>",

Some of these sites can be reached on foot but most of these sites can only be reached by boat.The campsites are nestled alongside the beautiful Green River in an area typical of a high desert environment.

The towering red canyon cliffs, ponderosa pine, glassy clear water, abundant trout and rapids (class I and II) are what make section &quot;A&quot; of the Green River world famous.

Limited access in this section allows for healthy brown trout populations to thrive. There are 17 river camps in Section B that can be accessed only by hiking or floating in.

The Civilian Conservation Corps built the complex in 1931 as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal. It was one of 11 guard stations built in the area to serve as homes for rangers who patrolled the forest on horseback prior to the modern age of vehicles. The complex includes the guard station, bunkhouse, parking area, and fenced yard. The Ashley National Forest has chosen to rehabilitate and rent this guard station and bunkhouse to the public so that guests can enjoy a rustic experience similar to that of the first rangers.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The complex is&nbsp;set in a rolling pasture, surrounded and interspersed with aspen and pine trees. Wildlife and summer flowers are abundant during the use season.</span></p><p><span itemprop=\"description\"><strong>Nearby Attractions:</strong><br />Flaming Gorge Recreation Area is known not only for its beautiful red cliffs, but also for its world -class fishing for lake, brown, and rainbow trout. Boating, water skiing, canoeing, kayaking, swimming, and scuba diving are popular activities on the reservoirs. The dam is about 23 miles east of the complex. Sheep Creek Loop Scenic Backway (Geological Loop) is a 10 mile drive through spectacular canyon scenery and back in time. Millions of years of geologic history can be seen in a 20 minute drive, thanks to the Uinta Crest Fault and other rock features. The town of Manila is about 15 miles away, off the north end of Sheep Creek Loop where visitors can find grocery stores and other amenities.</span></p><p><span itemprop=\"description\">Included in this complex:<br />&bull;Broom ",

The outlet stream from the lake flows northward and is joined by two other streams to form Three Creek. The lake is surrounded by old growth forest, and is easy to fish from shore; however, fishing from a boat is the most popular method. The lake elevation is 6,550 feet; it is an alpine gem resting at the base of Tam McArthur Rim south of Sisters. This 28-acre lake has planted rainbow trout and a self-sustaining population of brook trout, ranging from 8 to 15 inches. Most catches average around 10 inches. Trolling flies and lures, fishing from shore, and still-fishing with bait are all successfully used methods.</p><p>The shoreline of Three Creek Lake varies from gentle slope to rocky cliff, surrounded by old growth forest. Maximum depth is 28 feet down the center and near the cliff on the south end of the lake. Most of the lake is easy to fish from shore or by wading, but fishing from a boat is by far the most popular method. Motors are not allowed on Three Creek Lake, contributing to the serenity of the setting. There is a primitive boat ramp on the east shore as well as a small store that rents boats.</p><p><strong>Motorized boats are prohibited on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There is a primitive boat ramp on east shore near the store.</p>",

Managed by the U.S. Forest Service, this monument provides a unique opportunity to view the Lava Lands of central Oregon. <strong>Newberry National Volcanic National Monument </strong>includes 54,000+ acres of lakes, lava flows, and spectacular geologic features in central Oregon. The highest point within the Monument is the summit Paulina Peak (7,985 ft.), showcasing views of the Cascades, Newberry Caldera and across the High Desert.</p><p><img alt=\"Aerial view of Lava Butte.\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprd3824141\" width=\"206\" />&nbsp;Although commonly referred to as Newberry Crater, the &quot;crater&quot; is in fact a caldera formed when the overlying rocks collapse when a magma chamber is emptied. The caldera stretches across&nbsp;17 square miles in the heart of the volcano. The 1,200 square mile volcano (about the size of Rhode Island) remains very active to this day. Newberry is both seismically and geothermally active. Geologists believe the caldera sits over a shallow magma body only 2 to 5 kilometers deep. Visitors see numerous cinder cones and vents (over 400 throughout the area), miles of basalt flows, as well as rhyolite flows of obsidian.</p><p>For up-to-date facts on Newberry Volcano, click ",

It served as both a passenger and freight station, and played a significant role in the development of north Florida. This part of Florida has always had a rural economy based on agriculture and timber. Prior to the railroad, transporting these products was difficult and time consuming. Mule-drawn wagons were used to carry goods to waterways, where the goods could be shipped to their final destination.</p><p>But, in 1860, the railroad line from Jacksonville to Alligator (later renamed Lake City) was completed and provided the people of Olustee with a new mode of transportation, a faster way to ship supplies, and a link to the outside world. It was this platform that felt the pounding of Confederate soldier&#39;s boots as they arrived and prepared for battle in 1864.</p><p>After the Civil War and by the 1880s, industries such as timber, cattle, citrus, winter vegetables and tourism were booming. For rural north Florida, the major commodities were timber and turpentine. Sawmills and turpentine stills were big business in the Olustee area and continued for many generations. From the 1880s to 1949, Florida produced as much as 20% of the world&#39;s supply of turpentine. These products were shipped from the depot.</p><p>The Freight Room was built in 1888, with the Station Master&#39;s Room and the Waiting Rooms added in the 1920s.</p><p>Until the 1960s the Olustee depot served as the hub of this community with trains stopping daily to deliver mail, export supplies and bring people to and from Olustee. In 1965, it was moved to a cow pasture in nearby Lake City. The Osceola National Forest acquired the depot in 1995 with assistance from federal, state and local partners, and moved it back to Olustee. Over the next five years, the depot was restored and converted into an interpretive/information center. The local community c",

They returned in September and evidently traveled by the Old Horse Lake Trail from its junction with the Green Lakes Trail and passed by Moraine Lake and on to Wickiup Plains. It is guessed that this group went past Devils Pass, Devils Lake, and followed the approximate route of the north Century Drive.</p><p>The lake was formed about 10,000 years ago when lavas from the Mt.

The resulting explosions formed a broad shallow crater, which later filled with water. North Twin has 112 surface acres, average depth of 40&rsquo;, and a maximum depth of 60 feet. The pine forests that ring North Twin are open at the beach and boat ramp on the north shore. The lake harbors healthy numbers of stocked rainbow trout and illegally introduced bullhead. Fishing for rainbow trout here can be very good with an average catch is 8 to 12 inches in length.</p><p>Locals do well angling near the shorelines early and late in the day using bait, flies, or lures. The best bait fishing is along the west shore in the deeper holes using red eggs, power bait, or marshmallows and worms suspended just off the bottom. Rooster Tails, Panther Martins, and dark flies trolled slowly or cast toward shore catch many fish. Fly-fishing is most effective near shore as there are some good hatches of mayflies, caddis, damsels, and flying ants. A boat or float tube is best for fishing on the lake, due to the limited space for back casts.</p><p><strong>Motorized boats are prohibited on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38940\">North Twin Boating Site</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The state record brook trout, weighing at 9 pounds, 6 ounces, was taken from the river below the lake in 1980.</p><p>Little Lava Lake is a small, forest lake about a half-mile south of &quot;Big&quot; Lava Lake. This 130-acre lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and supports planted rainbow trout average of 6 to12 inches, some brook trout, and self-sustaining populations of whitefish and tui chub. The fishing here is not as good as at Lava due to competition from the tui chub population. However, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife started control of the tui chub in 1997.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38918\">Little Lava Lake Boating Site</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

With good fishing for rainbow and brook trout, Little Cultus is a great place to take the family for a quiet weekend of fishing and camping. Rainbow trout angling, 11-17 inches are the primary fishery. Brook trout stocking ended in 1997 but some fish up to 16 inches are still found.</p><p>Little Cultus&#39; gently sloping shorelines are easily wadable. The deepest spots, up to 60 feet deep, are in the center of the lake. Angler&rsquo;s troll flashers with a trailing night crawler or use single lures, such as a gold Thomas lure or yellow Rooster Tail. Trolling slowly along drop-offs is a commonly used technique here. Bank fishing is best along the north shore of the lake, using bobbers and worms, spinners, spoons, or a marshmallow and worm fished near the bottom. The fish at Little Cultus Lake often surface feed on emerging damselflies and mayflies. Fly fishers should be well prepared with mayfly dries, ant imitations in sizes 10 to 14, damsel nymph imitations, and Woolly Buggers.

Lava Lake is relatively old as evidenced by the extrusive vegetation occurring in the shallow areas. Rushes, waterlilies and other emergent plants are especially evident on the west and northern perimeter. Another indication of the lake&rsquo;s aging is the 4 to 5 feet deep layer of muck located on the lake bottom as reported by divers.</p><p>Subsurface springs provide the primary inflow to Lava Lake. The springs are located in the northeast corner of the lake at a depth of 20 to 30 feet. Water temperatures from the inflow vary between 45&deg; to 60&deg; F. There are no permanent surface streams entering the lake, however, intermittent seeps do enter the lake from Wire Meadow. &nbsp;Lava Lake connects with Little Lava Lake only occasionally during periods of spring high water. The outlet channel is located in the southeast corner of the lake. Water level fluctuates an average of approximately 2.5 feet annually with maximum pool occurring in late summer. Timing of the peak pool level is consistent with flow levels typical of springs in the area.</p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38896\">Lava Lake Boating Site</a>, &nbsp;and Lava Lake Resort.</p>",

This large lake is 3562 acres, 6 miles long and 1 1/2 miles wide, and reaches a depth of 282 ft. The average depth is 132 ft. which makes it ideal habitat for lake trout (Mackinaw) and bull trout. Rainbow trout, kokanee salmon and whitefish also naturally reproduce in this lake. Odell Lake is managed as a trophy lake trout fishery and has the distinction of the last two state record lake trout being caught here. The current state record is a 40 lb 8 oz 45.5 inch long giant caught in 1984 by Kenneth Erickson. Bull trout is listed as a threatened species with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and is thus closed to angling.</p><p>Odell Lake also offers beautiful campsites tucked away in thick forests and some excellent wind surfing. Boats are the most effective way to fish this lake but be aware of afternoon winds; the lake can get dangerously rough.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/deschutes/recreation/recarea/?recid=39090\">Princess Creek Boating Site</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/deschutes/recreation/recarea/?recid=39114\">Sunset Cove Boating Site&nbsp;</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/deschutes/recreation/recarea/?recid=39122\">Trapper Creek Boating Site</a>, Odell Lake Resort and Shelter Cove Resort.</p>",
