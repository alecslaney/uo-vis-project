Bowman Dam is an earthen fill structure on the Crooked River that has created the Prineville Reservoir. The main input streams are the Crooked River and Bear Creek with lesser streams (Sanford Creek, Deer Creek, Alkali Creek, Antelope Creek, and Owl Creek) and the output stream is the Crooked River. The reservoir is for irrigation and flood control, which has allowed for all types of water recreational activities in the heart of high desert juniper and sage. The reservoir is open the year round and because of its location it is a great place for ice fishing (Dec-Feb) (using bait such as cheese, eggs, and worms).&nbsp;</p><p>Most human activity occurs at the State Park or on expansive water. To escape the human crowd and see more wildlife, drive east on a dirt road that follows the northeast shoreline for 6 miles to Combs Flat Road. That portion of the lake is more shallow and narrow, and the shoreline is mudflat, meadow, or willow shrubland. The northern-most length of this road parallels Crooked River, which is the reservoir&#39;s primary feeder stream.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>A back road from the State Park northeast to pavement at Combs Flat Road is muddy in the wet season and may be closed by pipe gates 0.3 mile and 2.6 miles from the respective termini.</p><p><strong>Boat launching is available at the following locations: </strong>Crook County Boat Ramp (US Bureau pf Reclamation), Jasper Point (state), Powderhouse Cove (US Bureau of Reclamation), Prineville Reservoir Resort (private), Prineville Reservoir State Park (state), and Roberts Bay East (US Bureau pf Reclamation).</p><ul><li><strong>Website:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"\">www.oregonstateparks.org</a></li></ul>",

From Salt Creek Sno-Park, walk the access road back to Highway 58. Use extreme caution when crossing the highway to gain access to Fuji Creek Road.</p><p>From there, begin a moderate/steep climb of 1,500 feet over four miles. There are several openings along the way, which offer excellent views of Diamond Peak and the Salt Creek canyon. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/willamette/?cid=stelprdb5109521&amp;width=full\">Fuji Shelter</a>, perched at 5,600 feet, is located off the road on the left. Look for the sign marking your turnoff. The shelter has a wood stove, sleeping loft and a superb view of Diamond Peak.</p><p>For the more accomplished skier, an alternative route is to ski up Fuji Mountain Trail from the Waldo Lake Road and take the Fuji Shelter Tie to the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/willamette/?cid=stelprdb5109521&amp;width=full\">shelter</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

The trail rises through several types of vegetation and terrain, including deep timber, rocky outcroppings with dramatic towering faces, exposed flowering rocky slopes, and the grassy mountaintop area.

Near the top it levels out through smaller sub-alpine type trees and bear grass, rewarding the hiker at the top with sweeping wilderness and lake vistas to the east. The Three Sisters stand out sharply to the northeast, and myriad smaller lakes are visible in the watersheds to the north and south. This is a spectacular closeup view of the Crest along its spine.</p><p>Waldo Mountain Lookout is maintained and staffed by Middle Fork Ranger District. It is an especially valuable observation post during the frequent lightning storms along the Crest. Though built in the 1950s, it is outfitted and furnished with original furniture and cabinetry, making it very authentic as well as comfortable.</p><p>If you choose to hike from <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/willamette/recreation/recarea/?recid=4504\">North Waldo Campground</a>, be very sure you have each trail number and junction clearly in mind, as it requires several judgment turns and some rather extreme changes in direction. It can be very confusing. In particular, if you continue along the western edge of the lake too far, past the outlet of the North Fork, you&#39;ve missed your turn. Use a Forest trail map and observe the numbers closely. It can be done, in and out, in a day, but it will take all day.</p>",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>Warner Mountain Lookout is the winter wonderland destination for avid winter sports enthusiasts looking for a challenge. This replica of an old cupola-style lookout sits on a high vantage point of Warner Ridge at an altitude of 5,300 feet approximately 75 miles southeast of Eugene, Oregon. The lookout towers over forest cover of noble fir, mountain hemlock and silver fir at the crest of Warner Mountain. The lookout is close to Middle Fork Willamette River - Moon Point Trail Area, with a diverse habitat ranging from meadows to rocky cliffs and dotted with high-elevation conifers.</p><p>This is a very remote location; the road to the lookout is not plowed or maintained for winter travel. The lookout can only be accessed by skis, snowmobiles or snowshoes, a distance of 2-10 miles. Conditions on the mountain change rapidly. You need to be evaluating conditions and weather throughout your stay. Sudden storms and high winds may make skiing and driving conditions difficult. Experience in cross-country skiing or snowshoe travel is highly recommended. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities. The reward is worth the effort of getting there. Guests will enjoy panoramic views of the pristine snow-covered landscape and starry skies on clear nights.</p><p>The 14x14-ft. cabin sits atop a 40-foot tower and is surrounded by a catwalk. The cabin accommodates 4 people and is furnished with one double bed that comfortably sleeps two, a table and chairs, propane stoves for heating and cooking, cookware, dishes, broom and a 2-way radio for emergency use.&nbsp;There is an outhouse nearby. No water or electricity is provided. Guests typically melt snow for their supply of water for drinking, cooking and washing. A large pot is provided for this purpose.Items such as bedding, extra mattresses, flashlights, matches, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies, trash bags, dish soap, and towels are not reliably available after mid-season. Guests are expected to pack o",

They were the smoke chasers, often riding on horseback through the tall timbers to the location spotted by the lookout tower guards. The first on the scene, they often tried to put out any fires they may have found on their own, or reported back for additional help.<br /><br />The guard station is accessible by car. Some creature comforts are already provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.</p><p>The 16x24-ft. cabin sleeps 4 and comes furnished with 2 twin beds with mattresses, a desk, a sofa bed, a table with chairs, wood stove and cleaning supplies. An outhouse, fire ring and picnic table are located nearby. A horse corral that measures approximately 45 feet in diameter is provided. Electricity, firewood and potable water are not provided. Guests must bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Water is available from a nearby stream, but it should be treated before using.

The Forest Service first used Fish Lake as a ranger outpost in 1905. During the 1920s, it served as the field and dispatch headquarters for the Santiam National Forest, (the predecessor of the Willamette National Forest).</p><p>The day use area with picnic tables and interpretive signs sits adjacent to Fish Lake. A viewing platform takes you to the lake&#39;s edge. Fish Lake is a seasonal lake that only has water in winter and spring. In the summer, the water drains underground, leaving a lush meadow.</p><p>Two restored remount depot cabins, the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/willamette/recreation/recarea/?recid=4407\">Commissary Cabin</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/willamette/recreation/recarea/?recid=4408\">Hall House</a> are open to the public and available to rent for overnight stays each winter from November to early April.</p><p>It&#39;s thanks to the hard work of Friends of Fish Lake that the area&#39;s historic structures have been restored and are open to the public and that future generations will have the opportunity to stand in this place and experience its special history.

They are operated by the Corps of Engineers as part of a system of thirteen multi-purpose dams and reservoirs that make up the Willamette Valley Project. These dams and reservoirs work together for the purposes of flood damage reduction, hydropower generation, irrigation, recreation, fish and wildlife enhancement, and downstream water quality improvement within the Willamette River drainage system.. To learn more about the lake and construction of the dam visit the Army Corps of Engineers website at <a href=\"http://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/\">http://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/</a></p><p>In late summer, early fall through spring, the water levels on Detroit and Big Cliff lakes are frequently drawn down to the point where boat launches are no longer available. Reservoir and river level information is available from the US Army Corps of Engineers&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/water/\">here</a>. Watch for obstructions near the shoreline such as submerged stumps, logs and rocks. Small craft should stay out of open waters when it is windy since dangerous waves can build up suddenly.</p><p>Fish Your National Forests: This site can be accessed by Passenger Car; Fish available include: Trout, Native Trout; Types of fishing available include: Shore, Motorized boat, Float tube, Fly, Spin, Bait; ADA Accessible fishing access with fishing pier, boat launch, and fish cleaning station</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/willamette/specialplaces/?cid=stelprdb5117244\">View more Popular Lake",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>Clear Lake has a long history of being a popular recreation spot in the high Cascades. It was discovered in 1859 by a party of men who were searching for a route over the Cascade Mountains. They had followed an Indian trail down Hackleman Creek and after con&shy;siderable scouting found Fish Lake and then Clear Lake.</p><p>Clear Lake is about 142 acres in size and lies at an elevation of 3,012 feet, with a maximum depth of 175 feet. It is one of the clearest and coldest lakes in the Cascades. It lies just off Highway 126 about 21 miles east of McKenzie Bridge. Clear Lake is excellent for canoeing and other non-motorized boats. Fishing is good at Clear Lake. Brook trout and cutthroat trout re&shy;produce naturally in the lake. Rainbow trout are stocked annually.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/willamette/recreation/recarea/?recid=4362\">Cold Water Cove Campground</a> has 34 campsites and each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring. Adjacent to the campground is the Clear Lake Resort at which cabins are rented and there is a grocery and tackle shop with a restaurant that sells meals during the recreation season, from about late May through the fall.</p><p>How did geological processes shape what you see at Clear Lake? Why is the water so clear and blue? What other diverse features exist because of a volcanic eruption 3,000 years ago? Take a walk along the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/willamette/recreation/recarea/?recid=4481\">Clear Lake Loop Trail</a> to discover the answers as you walk through groves of ancient firs and across stark fields of lava to the source of the McKenzie River.</p><h3>Visiting the Clear Lake area, you&rsquo;ll discover a diverse landscape.</h3><p>This landscape, though, is very different from what it was 3,000 years ago. At that time, there was no lake here, only a densely forested drainage dissected by a rumbling white-water river. About 1,000 B.C., Sand Mountain erupted. Lava flowed out toward the McKenzie River and burned the forest as it moved. W",

Between Little Redfish Lake and Redfish Lake there are commercially operated showers, a gas station with propane, a dump station and horse rentals. Little Redfish Lake does not allow motorboats.

Redfish Lake is located next to the beautiful Sawtooth Wilderness. <!--StartFragment-->Redfish Lake is at the headwaters of the Salmon River, whose waters flow north to meet the Snake River and continue to the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean. As late as the 1950&#39;s, more than 4,000 sockeye salmon made the annual 900-mile (1,440-km) pilgrimage from the ocean to their spawning grounds in the Sawtooth Valley. However, in recent years only between 2-20 have returned each year. In an effort to save the endangered fish, whose bright red color gave Redfish Lake its name, the National Marine Fisheries Service established a local hatchery. Since 1999, the lake has been stocked with sockeye salmon. Bull trout, steelhead and Chinook salmon can also be spotted in the area. <!--EndFragment--></p>",

It is easy to locate and is accessible practically year-round. There are over 15 miles of looping Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) trails that travel across over 3,000 acres of public land jointly managed by the Forest Service (FS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Wyoming State Trust. There is plenty of OHV fun for the whole family as the trails offer varying degrees of difficulty from beginner to more experienced and include two trail bridges and hill climbs. The majority of the trails are only open to OHV&rsquo;s less than 60 inches on BLM and 50 inches on FS. Development of this area has been gradually improving with more planned in the near future. There are several parking areas located along the main road with the largest just off the highway. A vault toilet is located one mile in and is across from Weston Reservoir Pond where large trout are just waiting to be caught. The area also caters to other outdoor pursuits with the many dispersed campsites located on the FS along FSR 1246 with the best sites located at the top of the buttes on BLM land. There are plans to re-surface the main road and parking area in 2020/2021. Visitors should currently be prepared for a muddy road during wet periods.</span></p>",

Downstream, the canyon opens up, where bighorn sheep, deer and elk may be seen. You will also notice the large fire that swept through this area. In July of 1996, 7,000 acres were burned as the result of a lightning strike. Watch the area regrow as the years go by.&nbsp; It is managed by the Douglas Ranger District.</p>",

Third Fork Trail (#004) is an easy multi-use trail that accesses an extensive trail system including Wahlstrom Hollow (#38) and Rim View Trails (#235), the latter a hiking/horse trail over moderate terrain. Rim View Trail is 9.5 miles long and runs from Buckskin Ridge to the confluence of Third and Fourth Forks of Rock Creek; it is open to foot and horse travel only. There is an approximate gain of 1900 ft. from the third Fork Trailhead end of the trail on Buckskin Ridge as it generally follows a gentle moderate grade of 8%. The trail crosses several live streams and for the most part goes through areas covered with sub-alpine fir and aspen trees. Excellent views of Rock Creek abound as the trail traverses the canyon rim along the west side of Rock Creek. During the winter, there is great skiing on the Rock Creek Trail, just south of this campground. Opening off the head of Rock Creek are 4 cross-country ski trails ranging in length from 1.2 to 8.1 miles; three of the trails are groomed and signed.</p>",

Wildflowers, wildlife and recreation opportunities abound on its five unique divisions--Cassia, Albion, Sublett, Raft River and Black Pine. The Cassia Division, 40 miles south of Twin Falls, contains over 450 miles of streams, including the main Rock Creek drainage, popular with many anglers. The Albion Division, located 20 miles southeast of Burley, is home to Cache Peak (10,339 ft.), which is the tallest peak in the Albion Mountain Range. The Sublett Division, located east of Idaho Interstate 84, offers fishing and camping near Sublett Reservoir. The Raft River Division, located in northern Utah, northwest of Salt Lake City, offers an expansive view from its 9,600 ft. mountain peaks of the Great Salt Lake, Snake River Plain, the Sawtooth Mountain Range and into the state of Nevada. The Black Pine Division located east of the Albion Division and west of Idaho Interstate 84 near the Idaho/Utah border, is popular for gathering pine nuts, the gourmet snack of the pinyon pine tree which grows abundantly in the area. Recreation is undoubtedly the most popular pursuit on the Minidoka Ranger District. Summer activities include camping, picnicing, hiking, rock climbing, horseback riding, mountain biking, and all-terrain vehicle trail machine riding. Winter brings opportunities for alpine and nordic skiing, and snowmachine travel. Hunting and fishing are popular on the District. Six alpine lakes, three reservoirs, and numerous streams are included within the District boundaries. Forested areas and rangeland provide habitat for wildlife species including mule deer, moose, elk, wild turkey, bobcat, cougar, many small mammals, and a wide variety of birds. The District manages (#?) camping units in 25 developed campgrounds.&nbsp; The district maintains over 341 miles of trails to meet needs for motorized and non-motorized use.</p>",

The Northwest Indians named this cliff-rimmed basin &ldquo;Tamolitch,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;bucket.&rdquo; Today, this rocky section of the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/willamette/recreation/recarea/?recid=4479\">McKenzie River National Recreation Trail</a> from Trail Bridge Reservoir north along the McKenzie River and the stunningly clear water of the pool draw hundreds of hikers, photographers and mountain bikers.</p><p>A lava flow from&nbsp;Belknap Crater 1,600 years ago buried a 3 mile (4.8&nbsp;km) stretch of the McKenzie River between Carmen Reservoir and&nbsp;Tamolitch Falls. The river resurfaces at Tamolitch Pool at the base of dry Tamolitch Falls, seeping up to the surface through the porous lava, creating a pristine turquoise blue colored pool. The water, a chilly 37 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 C) on average, reflects the surrounding cliffs covered with alder and evergreen trees. While the falls are dry the majority of the time, during wet winters the river can flood over the lava bed and Tamolitch Falls will flow.</p><p>With the popularity of Blue Pool, please help protect this area and preserve the experience for you and for future visitors.&nbsp;Practice&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/seven-principles-overview\">Leave No Trace Principles</a>&nbsp;during your visit.

The geographic area includes both the Big and Little Snowy Mountain ranges. The Snowies display prominent changes in elevation accentuated by surrounding grassland, high plains, and foothill savanna.</p><p>The Little Snowy Mountain range has a rich cultural history, beginning with first peoples then homesteading. Today, large ranches maintain the open character of the area. Pine Grove Cemetery continues to be the final resting place for early Euro-American occupants. The Little Snowies are separated from the Big Snowies by a subtle break in topography. It is characterized by foothills that are partially forested with mostly ponderosa pine. In general, the country is semi-arid and dominated by grassy vegetation. Landform is rolling with slopes that are gentle to flat, except where creeks have dissected them. Creeks within the Little Snowies are small and often run dry during the summer months. The major drainages are Willow Creek and the North Fork of Pole Creek, both of which drain south to the Musselshell River.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/helena/home/?cid=fseprd500269\">More information on the Snowy Mountains</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5435247.pdf\">Brochure of hiking opportunities in the Crystal Lake area.</a></p><p><strong>Bears may frequent the area; keep all food out of sight in approved containers and remove all food from area after eating.

Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>The cabin is situated on McKinley Lake and is surrounded by a dense spruce and hemlock forest. Steep mountainous terrain encircles the area.<br /><br />Visitors will be treated to an abundance of wildlife. Loons and other waterfowl find habitat on the lake, while sockeye salmon splash and spawn in the nearby creek. Sitka black-tailed deer, moose, black and brown bear also inhabit the forest. Learn more about&nbsp;bear&nbsp;and&nbsp;moose&nbsp;safety in Alaska.</p><p><strong>Recreation:&nbsp;</strong>McKinley Trail provides access to both the McKinley Trail Cabin, located just 100 yards from the trailhead, and this cabin, which is about 2.25 miles from the trailhead. The trail meets the shoreline of the lake at its southern lobe and at the cove at its upper end. Hiking approximately a quarter-mile beyond the cabin, visitors will find remnants of the Lucky Strike Mine. Rusting machinery, pipes and a collapsed tunnel are the most obvious evidence of the mine site.<br /><br />At approximately 1.25 miles from the McKinley Trail trailhead is the junction for the Pipeline Lakes Trail, which wanders through muskeg meadows and spruce-hemlock forests below steep mountainsides. In the spring, brown bears can be seen grazing on the new grass on the south-facing slopes.<br /><br />Anglers will find cutthroat trout near inlet creeks and gravel shoals near the cabin, and more healthy coho and sockeye at the mouth of the lake outlet. Many anglers concentrate on the Dolly Varden that follow the sockeye to eat their eggs. Walki",
