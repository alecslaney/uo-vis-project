A miniature spring-fed seasonal creek flows through the campground, and a hand operated pump provides well water. <em><strong>Special note</strong>: In 2009 a root disease was discovered in the campground that affected all of the white fir trees, killing some and infecting others. These hazardous trees were removed in early 2011 to allow the campground to be reopened for use. A major effort by the Forest Service to clean up the debris and replant non-affected native species in the campground occured throughout the spring of this year. Although the&nbsp;area has been temporarily impacted, in time nature will restore this popular campground to pristine conditions.</em></p>",

Trailblazers can choose any where between a scenic, quarter-mile hike to Backbone Creek (particularly colorful in autumn) to a 19-mile+ backcountry mountain excursion that continues through an extensive forest trail system. Big and Little Boulder Lake Trail is an easy and rewarding two mile hike leading to sights of impressive granite walls, deep blue waters, conifer forests and showy wildflowers. Hobo Gulch to Grizzly Lake Trail is for the experienced hiker; trail affords views of a large alpine lake and a 70-foot waterfall. A popular choice is Stuart Fork Trail that starts from Bridge Camp Campground. The trail has very little elevation variation, good fishing opportunities and the option of continuing 15 miles to Sapphire Lake.</p><p>Mountain biking is a popular pastime on the TRMU. Several trails afford experiences for the novice and experienced biker. Some trails are moderately strenuous requiring the rider and bike to be in fairly good shape. The scenic vistas are worth the effort: Trinity Alps, Trinity Divide and Trinity Lake. A great mountain bike ride for people of all experience levels is along the Minersville Trail that parallels the shoreline of Trinity Lake.</p><p>Anglers will find cold, clear running streams on the unit providing excellent catches of steelhead, silver salmon and Chinook salmon in the Trinity River and native rainbow trout in tributary creeks and streams.</p>",

There are nine picnic sites with tables and vault toilet. Drinking water available. No fee. Day use only. Parking suitable for larger vehicles. ADA accessible. Features: This scenic picnic area overlooks Lower Falls on the McCloud River. It is a great destination for a lunch break, and is also the trailhead for adventuresome hikers exploring the McCloud River Trail. A half mile upstream from the picnic area, hikers will pass Fowlers Camp and another 1.3 miles will bring them to the base of Middle Falls, the highest of the three waterfalls. From here, the trail leaves the river and climbs via a short series of switchbacks and stairs to the rim of the canyon. An observation platform offers panoramic views from above the Middle Falls. For non-hikers, this viewpoint is accessible by vehicle and ADA trail from the nearby parking area just north of the falls. The rim trail continues upriver for another half mile to the Upper Falls Overlook and day use area, then eventually all the way to Algoma (15 miles). Round trip to see all three falls and return to the picnic area is approximately three and a half miles.</p>",

On December 19, 2002 the Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002 added 33,967 acres to the existing wilderness bringing it to a total of 240, 026 acres. Topography of the Ventana Wilderness is characterized by steep-sided, sharp-crested ridges separating V-shaped youthful valleys. Most streams fall rapidly through narrow, vertical-walled canyons flowing on bedrock or a veneer of boulders. Waterfalls, deep pools and thermal springs are found along major streams. Elevations range from 600 feet, where the Big Sur River leaves the Wilderness, to about 5,750 feet at the Wilderness boundary circumventing Junipero Serra Peak. Marked vegetation changes occur within the Wilderness. These changes are attributed to dramatic climate and topographic variations coupled with an extensive fire history. Much of the damage to vegetation is only temporary, since fire is an integral part of this Wilderness as it is of other areas of the Forest. Much of the Ventana is covered by chaparral. This brushy vegetative cover is typical of that found throughout Southern California fire susceptible mountains. The contrast of annual grass meadows and open pine stands may be found throughout the Wilderness. Deep narrow canyons cut by the fast moving Big and Little Sur Rivers support virgin stands of coastal redwood. Small scattered stands of the endemic Bristlecone Fir may be found on rocky slopes.</p>",

Near the top it levels out through smaller sub-alpine type trees and bear grass, rewarding the hiker at the top with sweeping wilderness and lake vistas to the east. The Three Sisters stand out sharply to the northeast, and myriad smaller lakes are visible in the watersheds to the north and south. This is a spectacular closeup view of the Crest along its spine.</p><p>Waldo Mountain Lookout is maintained and staffed by Middle Fork Ranger District. It is an especially valuable observation post during the frequent lightning storms along the Crest. Though built in the 1950s, it is outfitted and furnished with original furniture and cabinetry, making it very authentic as well as comfortable.</p><p>If you choose to hike from <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/willamette/recreation/recarea/?recid=4504\">North Waldo Campground</a>, be very sure you have each trail number and junction clearly in mind, as it requires several judgment turns and some rather extreme changes in direction. It can be very confusing. In particular, if you continue along the western edge of the lake too far, past the outlet of the North Fork, you&#39;ve missed your turn. Use a Forest trail map and observe the numbers closely. It can be done, in and out, in a day, but it will take all day.</p>",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>Warner Mountain Lookout is the winter wonderland destination for avid winter sports enthusiasts looking for a challenge. This replica of an old cupola-style lookout sits on a high vantage point of Warner Ridge at an altitude of 5,300 feet approximately 75 miles southeast of Eugene, Oregon. The lookout towers over forest cover of noble fir, mountain hemlock and silver fir at the crest of Warner Mountain. The lookout is close to Middle Fork Willamette River - Moon Point Trail Area, with a diverse habitat ranging from meadows to rocky cliffs and dotted with high-elevation conifers.</p><p>This is a very remote location; the road to the lookout is not plowed or maintained for winter travel. The lookout can only be accessed by skis, snowmobiles or snowshoes, a distance of 2-10 miles. Conditions on the mountain change rapidly. You need to be evaluating conditions and weather throughout your stay. Sudden storms and high winds may make skiing and driving conditions difficult. Experience in cross-country skiing or snowshoe travel is highly recommended. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities. The reward is worth the effort of getting there. Guests will enjoy panoramic views of the pristine snow-covered landscape and starry skies on clear nights.</p><p>The 14x14-ft. cabin sits atop a 40-foot tower and is surrounded by a catwalk. The cabin accommodates 4 people and is furnished with one double bed that comfortably sleeps two, a table and chairs, propane stoves for heating and cooking, cookware, dishes, broom and a 2-way radio for emergency use.&nbsp;There is an outhouse nearby. No water or electricity is provided. Guests typically melt snow for their supply of water for drinking, cooking and washing. A large pot is provided for this purpose.Items such as bedding, extra mattresses, flashlights, matches, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies, trash bags, dish soap, and towels are not reliably available after mid-season.

It was discovered in 1859 by a party of men who were searching for a route over the Cascade Mountains. They had followed an Indian trail down Hackleman Creek and after con&shy;siderable scouting found Fish Lake and then Clear Lake.</p><p>Clear Lake is about 142 acres in size and lies at an elevation of 3,012 feet, with a maximum depth of 175 feet. It is one of the clearest and coldest lakes in the Cascades. It lies just off Highway 126 about 21 miles east of McKenzie Bridge. Clear Lake is excellent for canoeing and other non-motorized boats. Fishing is good at Clear Lake. Brook trout and cutthroat trout re&shy;produce naturally in the lake. Rainbow trout are stocked annually.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/willamette/recreation/recarea/?recid=4362\">Cold Water Cove Campground</a> has 34 campsites and each site is equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring.

At that time, there was no lake here, only a densely forested drainage dissected by a rumbling white-water river. About 1,000 B.C., Sand Mountain erupted.

The surrounding landscape features alpine meadows, waterfalls, lava fields, glaciers and glacial lakes abundant with trout. The forest is dense and varied, with Douglas fir, silver fir, sub-alpine fir, mountain hemlock, true fir, lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine.<br /><br />The guard station was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and used as a dwelling for fire guards. They were the smoke chasers, often riding on horseback through the tall timbers to the location spotted by the lookout tower guards. The first on the scene, they often tried to put out any fires they may have found on their own, or reported back for additional help.<br /><br />The guard station is accessible by car. Some creature comforts are already provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.</p><p>The 16x24-ft. cabin sleeps 4 and comes furnished with 2 twin beds with mattresses, a desk, a sofa bed, a table with chairs, wood stove and cleaning supplies. An outhouse, fire ring and picnic table are located nearby. A horse corral that measures approximately 45 feet in diameter is provided. Electricity, firewood and potable water are not provided. Guests must bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Water is available from a nearby stream, but it should be treated before using. Items such as bedding, lanterns or flashlights, dishes and cookware, matches, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies, trash bags, dish soap, towels and an ice chest are not available. Guests are expected to pack out their trash and clean the cabin before leaving.</p><p>Trailheads into the Three Sisters Wilderness and the Chucksney Mountain Roadless Recreation Area are adjacent to the Guard Station.

Views from the lookout include the Three Sisters, which are close and prominent to the northeast, along with views of the Cascade Crest both north and south. The Sand Mountain and Carpenter Mountain Lookouts are visible with binoculars. Hidden Lake is visible below the northern edge of mountaintop. The ridge is covered with open beargrass and huckleberries. Several rocky outcroppings are covered by wildflowers and mossy vegetation, depending on the season.<br /><br />Built in 1958, the lookout was used for firefighting by Forest Service personnel until 1973. The lookout is still staffed occasionally during emergencies.<br /><br />The lookout is accessible by car, although the access road is rocky. Guests must be prepared to climb steep, narrow steps up the 30-foot tower to access the lookout&#39;s cabin. ThThe 16x16-ft. cabin sleeps 4 and is equipped with 2 twin beds with foam mattresses, a table with chairs, broom, mop and storage shelves. An outhouse with vault toilet is located 50 feet from the lookout.<br /><br />No heat, electricity or water are available. Guests must bring their own water for drinking, cooking and washing, in addition to a heat source. Propane stoves and lanterns are recommended, since they create less fumes than liquid gas appliances.<br /><br />Items such as a cook stove, bedding, flashlights, dishes and cookware, matches, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies, trash bags, dish soap, towels and an ice chest are not available.

Another 38 miles of trail, including the 10-mile Diamond Peak Trail, stretches the length of the west side of the peak.</p><p>Nearly the entire area is covered with mixed stands of mountain hemlock, lodgepole and western white pine, and silver, noble and other true firs.</p><h3>Know Before You Go</h3><ul><li>&#39;&#39;Leave No Trace&#39;&#39; techniques are encouraged in Wilderness areas, including properly disposing of human and pet waste and carrying out all trash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lnt.org/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>&nbsp;for more information.</li><li>There are no facilities within the Diamond Peak Wilderness.</li></ul><p><style type=\"text/css\">.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 80%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;} small{position: absolute; z-index: 40; bottom: 0; margin-bottom: -15px;}</style></p><div class=\"embed-container\"><small><a href=\"//usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=51f650f63d534c7a9d8f76c8faf3fd40&amp;extent=-122.3431,43.3823,-121.8624,43.6338&amp;home=true&amp;zoom=true&amp;scale=true&amp;legend=true&amp;basemap_gallery=true&amp;disable_scroll=true&amp;theme=light\" style=\"color:#0000FF;text-align:left\" target=\"_blank\">View larger map</a></small><br /><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/",

In an effort to save the endangered fish, whose bright red color gave Redfish Lake its name, the National Marine Fisheries Service established a local hatchery.

During that same&nbsp;time the country was&nbsp;experiencing a&nbsp;booming gold rush.&nbsp; Dick Owen worked at Hassel in the mines and possibly at the Park mines. By the early 1900&#39;s, the Owen&#39;s had moved to Radersburg, where Sarah Owen ran a boarding house.&nbsp; In 1905, the Elkhorn Forest Reserve was formed.&nbsp; In 1908, the Helena National Forest was designated and Eagle Cabin became an administrative site. The Eagle, Tizer and Glendale Stations were all&nbsp;linked by a telephone line and connected to&nbsp;the switchboard at a Radersburg store. The cabin is the oldest administrative log structure on the Helena National Forest and predates the establishment of the Forest.&nbsp; Eagle Station was used by the Forest Service on a regular basis until the early 1950&#39;s. Riders from the Crow and Indian Creek Livestock Association used the cabin over the years until the 1970&#39;s.&nbsp; Due to the historical value of Eagle Cabin,&nbsp;it&nbsp;has been determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. From 1991-1994, the Forest Service, with the help of volunteers and donated materials, restored the cabin. Primitive building skills and materials were used to restore the cabin&#39;s original features. The current site consists of the cabin, a woodshed, toilet, barn, horse corrals, a fire ring, and is surrounded by a jackleg pole fence. There is no potable water or electricity at the site. &nbsp;The cabin is heated with a wood stove; a propane camp stove is also provided for cooking. There are three bunk beds that accommodate six people. Also&nbsp;provided&nbsp;are: dishes, silverware",

Tables and charcoal grills here are tucked under mesquite and oak trees a short distance from Madera Creek. In addition to the single table sites, facilities include a large ramada for group get-togethers . Wildlife watching is at the top of the menu at Whitehouse. The Madera Nature Trail, portions of which are paved and barrier free, lead from the picnic area into a nearby mesquite and oak woodland and sycamore-shaded riparian area. This trail actually stretches from Proctor Trailhead, a short distance down-canyon from Whitehouse Picnic Area, to Roundup Picnic Area at the end of the Madera Canyon Road. Since it was built a bit at a time, tread surface and interpretive features vary along its length. Coues white-tailed deer regularly browse within sight of it, barely taking notice of the presence of nature lovers focusing binoculars and clicking cameras just a few feet away. An overlook of Madera Creek provides opportunities to view more secretive species such as javelina and coatimundi as they stop for a drink. Along the two paved loops of the trail, which the Green Valley Hiking Club helped construct, there are interpretive signs in English and Spanish pointing out historic sites and other points of interest. Trailside wooden benches provide opportunities for more leisurely contemplation. Trails, trailhead information stations and interpretive signs along the Madera Nature Trail are maintained by the Friends of Madera Canyon, a hard working group of volunteers dedicated to keeping this area as clean and inviting as possible.</p>",

This area is across the lake from the most popular facilities: the boat launch ramp, the lodge, and boat rental, so it is a bit away from the area of heaviest use. There are days, however, when even this out-of-the-way spot can be quite crowded. Picnic sites at Red Rock are located in a small, grassy, oak-dotted valley at the end of a graveled road. A short walk leads to the lake and the well-used trail that follows its shore line almost all the way around. If you like to fish, you&rsquo;ll be interested to know that the lake holds bass, catfish, crappie and sunfish. During the cool months of the year it is stocked with trout. If you like to birdwatch, this is a good place to do that, too. It offers a number of species of hummingbirds and warblers (in season), in addition to a variety of waterfowl. If picturesque scenery is what you&rsquo;re after, that&rsquo;s provided by the bluffs and mountains that surround the lake. Tables at Red Rock are a short walk downhill from the parking area, so be sure you don&rsquo;t pack in anything you don&rsquo;t want to pack out. No garbage service is provided.</p>",

Both of them are located within a few steps of <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coronado/recarea/?recid=25524\">Pe&ntilde;a Blanca Lake</a>. Upper Thumb Rock is situated on a low hill overlooking this 49-acre body of water that provides year-round fishing for bass, catfish, bluegill and sunfish, and in cooler weather, for stocked trout. Lower Thumb Rock is located along a seasonal stream that flows into the lake at the base of the hill topped by Upper Thumb Rock. Both of these picnic areas have tables sheltered by ramadas and both have their own restrooms. A set of stone steps leads down to the shore from Upper Thumb Rock, which is the more open of the two areas. Lower Thumb Rock is more sheltered than its hilltop neighbor and provides access to the lake via a short trail that is barrier-free. The public boat launching ramp is only a short distance away as well. Though these two lakeside picnic areas are open year-round, the 4,000 foot elevation of the area means the weather can be quite cool here during the winter and early spring. That may come as a surprise since the Mexican Border is only a few miles away. But cool weather makes the trout fishing better, and since the area is so much less crowded when it is cool, that may be the best time to visit.</p>",

Trails exist in many places only as routes kept open by cowboys driving their stock. These mountains are characterized by deep canyons, rocky outcrops and bald summits. Vegetation is predominantly thick chaparral with forests of ponderosa pine occupying high ridges. A stand of Douglas-fir grows on the sheltered north slope of Cottonwood Peak, the highest in the range. The granite cliffs, buttes and ridges of the Santa Teresas lend themselves to the weathering forces of nature in such a way that, in many places, they have been sculpted into strikingly picturesque formations. These natural works of art give the Santa Teresa Wilderness an unmistakable character. Because of this area&rsquo;s remote nature, it serves as ideal habitat for wildlife species that prefer a high degree of isolation. Among those are black bear and mountain lion. Other desert species, such as mule deer, coatimundi and javelina, can be found here as well. When added to this area&rsquo;s other notable attributes, the possibility of encountering some of these reclusive residents makes a trip to the Santa Teresa Wilderness well worth the effort.</p>",

As with all Cave Creek campgrounds, birdwatching is good right in the campground. It&rsquo;s also close to other areas that are less disturbed and therefore even more productive for adding to your life-list.</p><p>A short distance upstream from Stewart, the Vista Point Trail climbs above the canyon floor to offer unobstructed views of Cave Creek Canyon. Though this easy stroll has little elevation change, the view it presents is impressive. Other recreation amenities conveniently close to Stewart Campground include the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coronado/recarea/?recid=25416\">Silver Peak Trail #280</a>.</p><p>The South Fork area, famous for its birdwatching and beautiful riparian forest, is a short drive away. The campground is located on the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coronado/recarea/?recid=25328\">Cave Creek</a>/Portal-to-Paradise scenic drive.</p><p>Sites at Stewart have pull-ins making it one of the better places along Cave Creek for camping if you have an RV.

Once you get to this out-of-the-way recreation spot, one of the first things you&rsquo;ll notice is that the only facilities provided are a toilet and a primitive boat ramp. For some people that&rsquo;s not enough, and they usually turn around and leave. Those drawn to areas that are more primitive and less crowded, however, will choose to stay. Those who do stay will find that this 90-acre impoundment built by the Arizona Game and Fish Department is a good place to go fishing or birdwatching, to take a lakeside stroll or just plain sit back and relax. If you&rsquo;ve brought along your fishing gear, you can try your luck for largemouth bass, catfish or blue gill. Boats powered by single electric trolling motors are permitted on the lake. They make a pleasant way to explore the narrow inlets that branch off the main body of water. Arivaca Lake is located in an area of rolling grasslands set against a backdrop of rocky bluffs and distant mountains. This area is home to a number of cattle ranches, and much of the land in the vicinity of the lake is private property. Take that into consideration if you go strolling across the landscape. No garbage services are provided to this area, so even if you bag your trash neatly before you drive off and leave it, you&rsquo;re littering. Pack out everything that you pack in.</p>",

As you enter the East Stronghold Canyon, you pass in the shadow of rocks that quite likely served the Apache warrior as perches for his lookouts. The haunting shapes into which the forces of nature have carved those rocks helps make a visit to this charismatic place an unforgettable experience.Campsites at Cochise Stronghold are shaded by oaks and surrounded by a diverse community of vegetation that includes plants of both the Upper Sonoran and Chihuahuan Desert. To help you become better acquainted with this unusual environment, the Stronghold Nature Trail follows a 0.4 mile barrier-free loop that wanders among the yucca, cactus and rocks. This short, easy stroll provides a self-guided introduction to a number of desert plants as well as some of the principles of desert ecology. It also provides good views of the rocks that form the ramparts of the Stronghold. A barrier-free history trail in the campground tells of the area&rsquo;s colorful past. If you would like to retrace the steps of this area&rsquo;s historic residents even deeper into their nearly impenetrable refuge, you may choose to follow the Cochise Trail past dozens of fantastic rock formations as it makes its way across the Dragoons to West Stronghold Canyon and the Council Rocks historic area. Note: No potable water is available in the campground. Black bears in area. Accessible to persons with disabilities.</p>",

The 76,317-acre Galiuro Wilderness encompasses the mid to upper slopes of the mountains as they rise from golden grasslands, through dense thickets of evergreen oak, to stands of ponderosa pine. Douglas-fir and bigtooth maple inhabit cooler sheltered areas and a stand of aspen cloaks the northern slope of 7,671-foot Bassett Peak, the highest in the range. Two major canyons, Rattlesnake and Redfield, and twin ridges running northeast to southwest form the dominant geologic features of the area. A trail runs along each of these ridges providing access to a variety of connecting trails and spurs. The Galiuros are rich in both natural and cultural history. Wolves roamed these mountains until the mid-1950&rsquo;s. And black bear and mountain lion are still plentiful today. At Power Cabin, deep within the mountain range, one of the most famous of old west shoot-outs took place in 1918.</p>",

Some were Japanese Americans protesting the &ldquo;Japanese American Relocation,&rdquo; the largest forced removal and incarceration in U.S. History that started after the Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. Over 100,000 Japanese Americans, many American Citizens, were imprisoned in internment camps for fear they would conduct espionage and sabotage along the west coast.</span></p><p><span 10pt=\"\" style=\"font-family:;\">Gordon Hirabayashi was a senior at the University of Washington in 1942. He challenged the constitutionality of internment based on race or ancestry. He turned himself in to the FBI rather than report for relocation. He was convicted and sentenced to serve at the Federal Honor Camp in the Santa Catalina Mountains.</span></p><p><span 10pt=\"\" style=\"font-family:;\">In 1987, Hirabayashi&rsquo;s case was overturned. A federal commission determined that the internment had been motivated by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria. In 1988, the Civil Liberties Act was signed by President Ronald Reagan, which acknowledged the injustice and apologized for the internment.</span></p><p><span 10pt=\"\" style=\"font-family:;\">In 1999, the Coronado National Forest renamed the site in honor of Dr. Hirabayashi and the other resisters of conscience who were imprisoned there.

Water entered these cracks and gradually enlarged them into what is now known as Onyx Cave.</p><p>The cave is first mentioned in the accounts of pioneer ranchers and miners who came to the area in the 1870&#39;s and 1880&#39;s, although we know that Onyx was used by a succession of hunters, explorers and Indians because of various artifacts found in the small shelter cave adjacent to the main cave. The remains of a mill foundation can still be seen at the bottom of Onyx Hill. In the 1940&#39;s and 1950&#39;s, the cave became a favorite spot for adventurous people to explore. Increased use led to heavy vandalism. Broken formations and paint-scarred walls became the rule, not the exception. In 1963, the entrance was gated in an effort to preserve the remaining beauty of the cave. The gate was dynamited after a very short time, and no further efforts were made to save the cave until Escabrosa Grotto, Inc., leased Onyx and gated the entrance in 1974. Since that time, several large-scale cleanup and repair projects and numerous one day efforts have restored much of the cave&#39;s former beauty.</p>",

It offers a number of recreational possibilities for those willing to drive the long&nbsp;paved roads that lead to it. For those who like to fish, Parker Canyon Lake offers both cold and warm water species, including stocked rainbow trout and resident bass, sunfish, and catfish. To make landing those wily lunkers a bit easier, there is a fishing pier and a paved boat ramp at the lake, as well as a lakeside paved area and a graveled path along some of the best catfishing shoreline. There is also a concessionaire-operated country store at the lakeshore where you can pick up some last minute supplies, buy a fishing license, or rent a boat. Bird watchers and just plain nature lovers will also find much to enjoy at Parker Canyon Lake. A five mile trail leads around the shoreline never getting more than a few steps from the water. The Parker Lakeshore Trail offers excellent vantage points from which to enjoy the ducks and other waterfowl that are invariably bobbing on the lake&rsquo;s clear waters. Some of those points even have benches and interpretive signs. Bald eagles and osprey are regularly sighted in this area, as are spring warblers and hummingbirds in season. On the terrestrial side, Coues whitetail deer can frequently be seen browsing among the oaks and grasses that surround the lake and in the two campgrounds near its shores. Coatimundi, javelina, and roadrunners, three animals that are about as southwestern as you can get, make occasional appearances as well. Parking for vehicles, motor homes, boat trailers.</p><p>Fish Your National Forests: This site can be accessed by Passenger Car; Fish available include: Trout, Bass, Catfish, Panfish; Types of fishing available include: Mot",

Noon Creek thus became a traditional lunch stop along the historic travel route into the Pinale&ntilde;os and it remains a popular picnic spot today. The surroundings here are typical of mountain oak woodlands with junipers and scrub oaks standing as the tallest trees, while satin barked manzanita, saw-leafed sotol and soaptree yucca form a picturesque understory. As you enjoy your favorite picnic dish in this setting, keep an eye out for some of the local residents. You may catch a glimpse of a spiny lizard or a raspy-voiced cactus wren, a bird well adapted to life in this dry, bristling environment. Even if you don&rsquo;t see the latter, you can usually hear their raspy call. Watch for roadrunners, too, as they dart among the underbrush always on the lookout for a slithery meal.</p><p>Bear Warning: To avoid putting a bear&rsquo;s life in danger and risking the loss of some of your own property as well, please dispose of all garbage in the bear-proof containers provided. Also remember to keep all food out of reach and out of sight of these curious, powerful animals.

Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>The cabin is situated on McKinley Lake and is surrounded by a dense spruce and hemlock forest. Steep mountainous terrain encircles the area.<br /><br />Visitors will be treated to an abundance of wildlife. Loons and other waterfowl find habitat on the lake, while sockeye salmon splash and spawn in the nearby creek. Sitka black-tailed deer, moose, black and brown bear also inhabit the forest. Learn more about&nbsp;bear&nbsp;and&nbsp;moose&nbsp;safety in Alaska.</p><p><strong>Recreation:&nbsp;</strong>McKinley Trail provides access to both the McKinley Trail Cabin, located just 100 yards from the trailhead, and this cabin, which is about 2.25 miles from the trailhead. The trail meets the shoreline of the lake at its southern lobe and at the cove at its upper end. Hiking approximately a quarter-mile beyond the cabin, visitors will find remnants of the Lucky Strike Mine. Rusting machinery, pipes and a collapsed tunnel are the most obvious evidence of the mine site.<br /><br />At approximately 1.25 miles from the McKinley Trail trailhead is the junction for the Pipeline Lakes Trail, which wanders through muskeg meadows and spruce-hemlock forests below steep mountainsides. In the spring, brown bears can be seen grazing on the new grass on the south-facing slopes.<br /><br />Anglers will find cutthroat trout near inlet creeks and gravel shoals near the cabin, and more healthy coho and sockeye at the mouth of the lake outlet. Many anglers concentrate on the Dolly Varden that follow the sockeye to eat their eggs. Walki",
