One of the prominent peaks in the Selkirk Range still bears the name Roothaan. In 1865, Captain John Mullan designated this same lake as Kaniksu Lake on one of his maps. It is believed that &quot;Kaniksu&quot; was the Indian name of Black Robe, although this has never been authenticated. The name was gradually changed in the early 1900's from Kaniksu Lake to its present name of Priest Lake, which refers to the early-day Jesuit missionary priests who had established a base camp at Kalispell Bay in the 1840's. The lake is one of three largest and most beautiful lakes in the Idaho Panhandle, and a very popular recreation attraction. The world's largest Makinaw trout was caught here in 1963. Dolly Varden, Cutthroat, and Kokanee are also caught in the lake. It is now illegal to fish for Dolly Varden and they are to be returned to the lake when caught.<br /><br />Upper Priest Lake is part of the Upper Priest Lake Scenic Area. There were five small parcels of private land totaling about 420 acres on Upper Priest Lake. The Forest Service purchased these tracts in 1967 with the assistance of Nature Conservancy. The entire shoreline of Upper Priest Lake is now in either the State of Idaho or Federal ownership, and is administered as a scenic area.<br /><br />Upper Priest River, which flows into Upper Priest Lake, is one of the rivers to be studied for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers system along with the lower Priest River which was famous in the early days as a log-drive stream. The first recorded drive was in 1901 and the last in 1949. The greatest drive took place in 1931 when 50,000 cedar poles and 125,000,000 board feet or logs were herded down the river by the &quot;river pigs&quot;.</p>",

The Challis National Forest took ownership of the area in 1966, and in 1981, Custer was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Through the efforts of the Friends of Custer Museum, the site was kept open for public enjoyment. In 1990, the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation joined the Forest Service in managing Custer.

Its extensive backcountry can be accessed via trails from both the Coachella Valley and the alpine village of Idyllwild.</p><p>Jointly managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service, the Monument&rsquo;s boundary encompasses about 280,000 acres, including public lands within the BLM&rsquo;s California Desert Conservation Area and the San Jacinto Ranger District of the San Bernardino National Forest. The Monument includes two Federal wilderness areas -- the Santa Rosa and the San Jacinto.</p><p>The Monument was established by an Act of Congress on October 24, 2000, &quot;in order to preserve the nationally significant biological, cultural, recreational, geological, educational, and scientific values found in the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains&quot; (Public Law 106-351). Establishment of the Monument reflects the vision of local citizens and national leaders to ensure this special landscape is protected for all time.</p><p>Information about the Monument can be obtained at each agency office or at the link below. The Idyllwild Ranger Station is a good source for hiking information. The Idyllwild Nature Center offers natural and cultural history exhibits and the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument Visitor Center (760-862-9984) south of Palm Desert on Highway 74, has interpretive displays, information about the Monument, and hosts many events and activities.

This unpaved overlook offers views of Cajon Pass, home to Interstate 15 and 4 railway lines, this location is popular with railroad fans. Do not venture near the cliff. Open all year.</p><p>Cajon Pass is a moderate-elevation mountain pass between the San Bernardino Mountains and the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California in the United States. It was created by the movements of the San Andreas Fault. The Mojave Desert pass provides an important economic link from the Greater San Bernardino Area, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, to Victor Valley, and northeast to Las Vegas.</p><p>The California Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, was the first railroad to use the Cajon Pass as a route through the mountains. The rail line through the pass was built in the early 1880s as part of a connection between the present day cities of Barstow and San Diego.&nbsp; Today, the Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway (the successor to the Santa Fe) use this pass to access Los Angeles and San Bernardino. Due to the high volume of trains, noteworthy scenery and easy access, it is a popular location for railfanning, and numerous photographs of trains on Cajon Pass appear in books and magazines about trains. The current Amtrak Chicago-Los Angeles Southwest Chief passenger train travels through the pass.</p><p>The Union Pacific Railroad operates and owns one track through the pass, on the previous Southern Pacific Railroad Palmdale cutoff, opened in 1967. The BNSF Railway had two tracks and began to operate a third main track in the summer of 2008. The railroads share track rights through the pass ever since the Union Pacific gained track rights on the Santa Fe portion negotiated under the original Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. The original BNSF (ATSF) line was constructed in 1890 and later roads, U.S. Route 66 and I-15, roughly followed this route.</p><p><strong>The railfan ",

Recreation opportunities include two camping for fee campgrounds and two rustic campgrounds. Three wilderness areas are located on adjacent districts. The area's climate is truly unique for each season of the year. The weather is summarized as follows: 31 inches of average annual precipitation, 68 inches of snowfall, an average of 62 frost-free days, 59 degree F. average temperature May through September, and long cold winters.<br />Four-season recreation is Iron County's claim to fame. 2,175 lakes and 902 miles of streams offer unlimited challenges for both warm and cold-water fishing. Three rivers on the district have recently been designated as recreational rivers under the Wild and Scenic rivers Act. Northern hardwoods, pine, balsam fir, and spruce cover 80% of the county. More whitetail deer Boone and Crockett entries have been taken from the forests of Iron County than any other Michigan county. Add to this, the title of woodcock capital of the world and one cannot find any better small and big game hunting anywhere in the Midwest.<br />When winter arrives, it's no time to rest. 212 miles of snowmobile trails connect to a vast system of trails throughout upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin. The Iron River District, in cooperation with Covenant Point Bible Camp, grooms and maintains a Nordic ski trail, and Ski Brule, a major ski resort, is just minutes from town.</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>",

When the leaves of the hardwoods change color in the fall, they form a vivid tapestry.

The North Country National Scenic Trail parallels the northern and eastern boundaries for about eight miles. Sturgeon River Campground offers&nbsp;seven sites on the southeastern boundary.

Both the Wilderness and the recreation area receive high use, particularly during the summer season. Six developed campgrounds and a major visitor center, add to the heavy recreation program. The Ottawa Visitor Center is currently open year round with about 30,000 annual visitors.</p><p>Watersmeet is located in Michigan&#39;s Western Upper Peninsula, an area known for its woods and waters. This Headwaters area boasts beautiful, deep, clear, glacially formed lakes that provide water to the Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Mississippi Watersheds. Waterfalls are numerous and the major attractions to thousands of visitors annually.<br />The Watersmeet area is a perfect spot for fishing, picnicking, swimming, boating, canoeing, hiking, camping and hunting for grouse, black bear and white tailed deer. Tourism and timber products are the major industries in this area of forested hills and interspersed lakes and rivers. There are several resorts for those who wish to come to the Northwoods to stay in a comfortable cottage, or the Sylvania Wilderness for those wishing a more primitive experience in a pristine setting.<br />Watersmeet is in Big Snow Country where the rolling hills provide some of the best cross-country skiing in the mid-west. With snowfall averaging more than 100 inches a year, skiing usually begins in early December and sometimes doesn&#39;t end until after Easter. A half-dozen Alpine ski resorts are nearby - with Thanksgiving the declared opener for some. Major snowmobile trails cross the district and some trails even take the riders to view waterfalls in winter splendor<br />&nbsp;</p>",

The next water source is approximately 7 miles downstream (although in the spring it is not unusual to find water in other locations as well) at an area known as Wates Pond.

Canoeing and fishing for trout are popular at the ponds.<br />Many people enjoy the solitude and primitive experience of camping away from developed campgrounds and other campers. &quot;Dispersed camping&quot; is the term used for camping anywhere in the National Forest outside of a designated campground, and is generally allowed anywhere unless posted otherwise. Many people drive out on Forest Service roads into the woods and find spots that meet the needs for their camp.<br />Dispersed camping may mean no toilet facilities or treated water are located nearby. Typically, dispersed camping is not allowed near developed recreation areas such as campgrounds, picnic areas or trailheads. Some dispersed sites are provided with fire rings and in those cases please use them as they are designating that area as the spot to safely have a campfire. Finally some dispersed sites have a designated footprint for use. If you see a site with any type of barriers or fencing please respect these areas by not pulling motor vehicles or OHV&rsquo;s.

Unfortunately, over time as the trees aged, they became too diseased to make it feasible to leave them and still allow for safe camping. The tops had broken out of many, and they had very shallow root systems.</p><p>Renovations planned for the future include; new tables, fire rings, paved parking spurs and restrooms. All sites will be made accessible.</p><p>Kit Price is a beautiful campground overlooking the North Fork Coeur &#39;Alene River. Campers enjoy the benefits of the river by fishing along the banks, swimming and floating. Hiking is also a great way to see mountain views.</p><p><strong>Natural Features</strong>: The campground is situated along the North Fork Coeur d&rsquo; Alene River at an elevation of 2,550 feet. Campsites are very open with smaller trees and brush species dominating the area. Popular Coeur d&rsquo; Alene Lake is about 65 miles west of Kit Price. Wildlife in the region include mule deer, black bear, and osprey and calliope hummingbirds.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Tubing, swimming and kayaking on the North Fork Coeur &#39;Alene River are popular summer activities. Rafters like to head downstream for the class I-III rapids. Catch and release fishing for cutthroat trout is also popular.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Amenities include picnic tables, grills, paved parking spurs, accessible vault toilets and drinking water.

Their guide, John McLeod, a fur trader from the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, chose the most direct route, but it was too steep and rugged for wagons, and only suitable for horse and foot travel. Though tough, their journey into the Oregon Country was the first completed by an Anglo family, proving that women and families could make it across, and pioneered the way for others to follow.</p><p>The Whitman Mission served both the local Indians and new emigrants along the Oregon Trail for eleven years. After a Black Measles epidemic broke out and almost 200 Cayuse Indians, mostly children, died, the Cayuse took revenge against the mission. The Whitmans, eleven others and the mission itself, met a violent end in the Whitman Massacre of November 29, 1847.</p><p>Over the years, the original trail used by the Whitmans was lost as a new wagon route was found and frequented. In the early 1960s, U.S. Forest Service Ranger Gerald Tucker used Narcissa&rsquo;s travel journal to locate the Whitman&rsquo;s crossing of the Blue Mountains. Today, the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/umatilla/recreation/recarea/?recid=57077\">Whitman Route Overlook</a>, a short drive from the Summit Guard Station, offers a spectacular view of Meacham Canyon and the Hell Hole Roadless Area, as well as a look back into the history of the area.</p><p>Summit Guard Station is located on high ridge nested in an open stand of large Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. The view to the south from this ridge-top setting is exceptional.</p><p>The rustic bunkhouse, with one multi-use room for cooking, sleeping and relaxing, is furnished with a table and four chairs and four bed frames with mattresses.

It was built from a standard Forest Service plan known as the firemen&#39;s cabin. In 1935, a picnic area was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps across the road from the cabin and adjacent to the North Fork of the Coeur d&#39;Alene River. In 1940, a bathroom was added in a board and batten shed addition to the cabin&#39;s east side, and a rustic log garage was built behind the cabin. The cabin was used for crew housing until 1981.&nbsp;<br /><br />Newly renovated, the cabin is now fully accessible. Avery Cabin&#39;s central location along the North Fork Coeur d&#39;Alene River provides easy access to the site. Access to the cabin is along paved roadways, making it an easy destination to reach by car. The cabin is available from mid-May through September, and provides many of the comforts of home. Guests only need to bring a few of their own amenities for an enjoyable stay.</p><p><strong>Natural Features: </strong>Located in the heart of the Coeur d&#39;Alene Mountains along the North Fork of the Coeur d&#39;Alene River, Avery Creek Cabin is situated in a small grassy area surrounded by an evergreen forest at an elevation of 3,000 feet.&nbsp; From lush evergreen mountains to the banks of winding rivers, the Idaho Panhandle National Forests create a tapestry of land and water in northern Idaho. Rich in wildlife, the forest is home to large game such as elk and deer, as well as species such as grizzly bears, wolves and caribou that add to the sense of wildness.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>Guests can enjoy fishing for cutthroat or rainbow trout in the river.

The area is rich in history, including early Native American inhabitants and later in the 1860s, home to horse thieves and rustled livestock. Evidence of historical mining activity abounds in this area, especially in the nearby community of Crown King. Now, these peaceful mountains provide a variety of recreation activities for those wishing to enjoy both the heritage and beauty of the Bradshaws.</p><p><br /><strong>History</strong><br />The original cabin was built in 1939 as quarters and a staging area for Forest Service crews charged with protecting the southern end of the Bradshaw Mountains against wildfires. The cabin was remodeled and modernized over the years. However, by the 1980s, the cabin fell into disuse. It now enjoys a second life as a rental cabin, providing a unique recreation opportunity for visitors to the Prescott National Forest.</p><p><br /><strong>Amenities</strong><br />The cabin has running water, a flush toilet, shower, electricity, and first aid kit. The kitchen has all the basic amenities including a sink, propane stove/oven, refrigerator, table and six chairs.

In 1863, Arizona's first Territorial Capital was established nearby at Del Rio Springs, and the surrounding area has experienced explosive growth since the town of Chino Valley was incorporated in 1970.</p><p><br />Watershed, wildlife and range management, dispersed recreation, and fuel wooding are programs emphasized by the District. Chino Valley is also very involved in managing the Upper Verde River Area, habitat of some sensitive and endangered species. Ashes, willows, and cottonwood trees are common vegetation types found along the river banks.<br />Although the Chino Valley Ranger District does not have developed recreation sites, dispersed recreation is allowed anywhere on forest unless posted otherwise. One of the most heavily used recreation areas on the west side of the District is Camp Wood, located in the pines at an elevation of 5,700 feet. Approximately one mile north of Camp Wood is a riparian area, Emerald Glade, which is host to a variety of wildlife. This area was created by a masonry silt retention structure as part of our forest's wildlife habitat improvement program. The popular camping areas on the east side of the District are along the headwaters of the Verde River. The most popular trail is Sycamore Trail, located in the Sycamore Canyon Wilderness.</p><p><br />In addition to Sycamore Canyon, three other wilderness areas are located within the district: Juniper Mesa Wilderness and Apache Creek Wilderness on the west side, Woodchute Wilderness on the east side. For more information, please contact the Chino Valley Ranger District.</p><p>Map sales, free Motor Vehicle Use maps, permits, and information.</p>",

As early as the mid-1800&#39;s, mining first brought settlers to this part of Arizona. The Bradshaw Ranger District encompasses the Bradshaw Range and extends beyond it, surrounding the city of Prescott.<br />The Bradshaws offer cool relief from the desert below, with numerous developed and dispersed recreation opportunities available. Mount Union, in the Bradshaws, is the highest elevation on the forest, at nearly 8,000 feet. From 7,000 to 8,000 foot elevation along the Bradshaw Range, the vegetation changes from pure forests of ponderosa pine to mixed conifer forests of Douglas-fir and white fir. The weather throughout the Bradshaw District is moderate, with daytime temperatures averaging 50 degrees in the winter and 70 degrees in summer. Recreation opportunities abound throughout all seasons.</p><p><br />Granite Mountain Wilderness, the forest&#39;s only &quot;urban&quot; wilderness, is located just a few short miles from Prescott. Other scenic attractions include Thumb Butte, Lynx Lake and the Thumb Butte Loop, as well as drives to Palace Station and Crown King. For more information, please contact the Bradshaw Ranger District.</p><p>Map sales, free motor vehicle use maps, recreation opportunity guides, wood cutting permits, and information.</p>",

ATV enthusiasts can enjoy off-road riding at Hayfield Draw.</p><p><br />For relief from summer&rsquo;s heat, follow the winding highway up to Mingus Mountain and camp in the pines at Potato Patch Campground or Mingus Recreation Area; groups of 20 to 100 can reserve Playground Group Campground. Many of the District&rsquo;s hiking trails are located on Mingus, but it&rsquo;s also a great place to relax and enjoy panoramic views of the Verde Valley. A bit lower on the mountain, near the cluster of homes known as Cherry, Powell Springs Campground stays open all year.</p><p><br />To escape from the crowds, try a backpacking trip into Pine Mountain or Cedar Bench wildernesses, on the southeastern edge of the District. Bring your own water and be prepared for an abundance of wildlife such as bears, mountain lions, and javelina.
