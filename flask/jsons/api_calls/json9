The cabin is a good base camp for hunting. Fishing is available in several creeks within an easy drive (please check Colorado Division of Wildlife for fishing seasons and rules). The trailhead for the La Garita Wilderness (20 + miles west) can be reached via 4 x 4 and Forest Service roads. There is an ATV trail about 10 miles southwest of the cabin that travels to within 2 miles of the La Garita Wilderness. Reminder, no motorized vehicles allowed in any wilderness area. Wildlife in the area includes deer, elk and coyote. Moose have been spotted in the Moon Pass area, about 5 miles west. The cabin is surrounded by a buck &amp; pole fence.&nbsp;Visitors to the National Forest are responsible for knowing the rules and regulations of the forest. Travel maps for the Rio Grande National Forest can be obtained by calling the Forest Service Office in Saguache 719-655-2547 or Monte Vista 719-852-5941.</p>",

Or if you prefer solitude, escape into the solace of the forest and leave the world behind.</p><p><strong>Mather Memorial Parkway</strong><br />Created in 1931, this paved two-lane classic Cascades drive along Highway 410 from Enumclaw to the eastern edge of Mount Rainier National Park presents majestic views of Mount Rainier and surrounding peaks. More than 200 miles of trails accommodate hikers, horses and mountain bikes. Drive, hike or ride to the Suntop Lookout Cabin at the top of Forest Road 7315. Choose a primitive campsite along forest roads east and west of the parkway. In November buy a permit at the Enumclaw office and take the family out to the woods to cut your own Christmas tree. Most forest roads are unpaved and minimally maintained.

Located along a scenic byway near the Continental Divide, Upper Crossing Guard Station provides a remote setting that is easily accessible year-round via U.S. Highway 114. The brief dirt road leading to the cabin is actually the old stagecoach route, complete with historic graffiti that served as billboards advertising goods and services at the stagecoach stops. Though Upper Crossing Guard Station offers visitors relaxing solitude in a secluded setting, the cabin is situated near a paved highway and also offers numerous modern amenities, such as: running water, heated water, electricity, propane heat, a full bathroom (with ADA accessible shower) and ADA accessible kitchen with appliances. The cabin was recently remodeled and is the Rio Grande National Forest&#39;s most accessible facility to persons with disabilities, despite it being a remote and historic Forest Service Guard Station. Views from the cabin include the Continental Divide and unspoiled surrounding countryside, as well as some of the State&#39;s most scenic working ranches. The cabin sits at the confluence of two creeks and offers visitors the opportunity for various streamside activities, including fishing. The surrounding public lands are a wide open opportunity for visitors to enjoy all sorts of Colorado outdoor recreation.</p>",

Together with lush meadow and shrub-steppe uplands, these habitats support a diversity of wildlife seldom found in the high desert and is one of the most important waterfowl nesting areas in the region. The refuge is either home or a stopover location for over 220 species of birds. Of specific interest are canvasback ducks, trumpeter swans, greater sandhill cranes and sage grouse. Mule deer and pronghorn antelope can also be found in the area.</p><p>Ruby Lake is visible from the campground and offers excellent birding, fishing and hiking. The lake is stocked with largemouth bass and several species of trout. The Ruby Lake NWR headquarters is 2 miles north of the campground and offers visitor information.</p><p>The campground is located on the Hastings Cutoff route, near the Pony Express Trail and historic ruins of Fort Ruby. A new interpretive trail was recently constructed at the Fort Ruby historic site and provides insight on local history as well as spectacular views of the southern Ruby Mountains and beyond, all relatively uninterrupted by human development. The southern trailhead for the Ruby Crest National Recreation Trail at Green Mountain is located within a reasonable driving distance from the campground. Many dirt and gravel roads begin at Harrison Pass (just north of the refuge) and Overland Pass (south of the area) and provide enjoyable routes for jeeps, off road motorcycles, OHVs, and mountain bikes.</p><p>A forest of pinyon pine and juniper covers the area offering partial shade. The campground contains 33 single sites, 1 double and 1 handicap site with picnic tables and campfire rings. Vault toilets, drinking water and trash collection are provided during the main summer season,",

This unpaved overlook offers views of Cajon Pass, home to Interstate 15 and 4 railway lines, this location is popular with railroad fans. Do not venture near the cliff. Open all year.</p><p>Cajon Pass is a moderate-elevation mountain pass between the San Bernardino Mountains and the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California in the United States. It was created by the movements of the San Andreas Fault. The Mojave Desert pass provides an important economic link from the Greater San Bernardino Area, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, to Victor Valley, and northeast to Las Vegas.</p><p>The California Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, was the first railroad to use the Cajon Pass as a route through the mountains. The rail line through the pass was built in the early 1880s as part of a connection between the present day cities of Barstow and San Diego.&nbsp; Today, the Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway (the successor to the Santa Fe) use this pass to access Los Angeles and San Bernardino. Due to the high volume of trains, noteworthy scenery and easy access, it is a popular location for railfanning, and numerous photographs of trains on Cajon Pass appear in books and magazines about trains. The current Amtrak Chicago-Los Angeles Southwest Chief passenger train travels through the pass.</p><p>The Union Pacific Railroad operates and owns one track through the pass, on the previous Southern Pacific Railroad Palmdale cutoff, opened in 1967. The BNSF Railway had two tracks and began to operate a third main track in the summer of 2008. The railroads share track rights through the pass ever since the Union Pacific gained track rights on the Santa Fe portion negotiated under the original Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. The original BNSF (ATSF) line was constructed in 1890 and later roads, U.S. Route 66 and I-15, roughly followed this route.</p><p><strong>The railfan ",

Providing a picturesque backdrop to local communities, visitors can enjoy magnificent palm oases, snow-capped mountains, a national scenic trail, and wilderness areas. Its extensive backcountry can be accessed via trails from both the Coachella Valley and the alpine village of Idyllwild.</p><p>Jointly managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service, the Monument&rsquo;s boundary encompasses about 280,000 acres, including public lands within the BLM&rsquo;s California Desert Conservation Area and the San Jacinto Ranger District of the San Bernardino National Forest. The Monument includes two Federal wilderness areas -- the Santa Rosa and the San Jacinto.</p><p>The Monument was established by an Act of Congress on October 24, 2000, &quot;in order to preserve the nationally significant biological, cultural, recreational, geological, educational, and scientific values found in the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains&quot; (Public Law 106-351). Establishment of the Monument reflects the vision of local citizens and national leaders to ensure this special landscape is protected for all time.</p><p>Information about the Monument can be obtained at each agency office or at the link below. The Idyllwild Ranger Station is a good source for hiking information. The Idyllwild Nature Center offers natural and cultural history exhibits and the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument Visitor Center (760-862-9984) south of Palm Desert on Highway 74, has interpretive displays, information about the Monument, and hosts many events and activities.

One of the prominent peaks in the Selkirk Range still bears the name Roothaan. In 1865, Captain John Mullan designated this same lake as Kaniksu Lake on one of his maps. It is believed that &quot;Kaniksu&quot; was the Indian name of Black Robe, although this has never been authenticated. The name was gradually changed in the early 1900's from Kaniksu Lake to its present name of Priest Lake, which refers to the early-day Jesuit missionary priests who had established a base camp at Kalispell Bay in the 1840's. The lake is one of three largest and most beautiful lakes in the Idaho Panhandle, and a very popular recreation attraction. The world's largest Makinaw trout was caught here in 1963. Dolly Varden, Cutthroat, and Kokanee are also caught in the lake. It is now illegal to fish for Dolly Varden and they are to be returned to the lake when caught.<br /><br />Upper Priest Lake is part of the Upper Priest Lake Scenic Area. There were five small parcels of private land totaling about 420 acres on Upper Priest Lake. The Forest Service purchased these tracts in 1967 with the assistance of Nature Conservancy. The entire shoreline of Upper Priest Lake is now in either the State of Idaho or Federal ownership, and is administered as a scenic area.<br /><br />Upper Priest River, which flows into Upper Priest Lake, is one of the rivers to be studied for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers system along with the lower Priest River which was famous in the early days as a log-drive stream. The first recorded drive was in 1901 and the last in 1949. The greatest drive took place in 1931 when 50,000 cedar poles and 125,000,000 board feet or logs were herded down the river by the &quot;river pigs&quot;.</p>",

Unfortunately, over time as the trees aged, they became too diseased to make it feasible to leave them and still allow for safe camping. The tops had broken out of many, and they had very shallow root systems.</p><p>Renovations planned for the future include; new tables, fire rings, paved parking spurs and restrooms. All sites will be made accessible.</p><p>Kit Price is a beautiful campground overlooking the North Fork Coeur &#39;Alene River. Campers enjoy the benefits of the river by fishing along the banks, swimming and floating. Hiking is also a great way to see mountain views.</p><p><strong>Natural Features</strong>: The campground is situated along the North Fork Coeur d&rsquo; Alene River at an elevation of 2,550 feet. Campsites are very open with smaller trees and brush species dominating the area. Popular Coeur d&rsquo; Alene Lake is about 65 miles west of Kit Price. Wildlife in the region include mule deer, black bear, and osprey and calliope hummingbirds.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Tubing, swimming and kayaking on the North Fork Coeur &#39;Alene River are popular summer activities. Rafters like to head downstream for the class I-III rapids. Catch and release fishing for cutthroat trout is also popular.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Amenities include picnic tables, grills, paved parking spurs, accessible vault toilets and drinking water. Kit Price does not have electric hookups.</p>",

In the rush, mining towns popped up here and there, only to be left to ruin as the mining dwindled. The nearby town of Granite is one such ghost town, with weathered buildings and the graves of prospectors and pioneers who came to seek their fortunes.</p><p>In 1903, local mines began to notice a decline in earnings and promoted construction of a cheaper power source in an effort to operate the mines more economically.&nbsp; As a result, the Fremont Powerhouse was constructed and began operation&nbsp;in 1908.&nbsp; Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake and water from the lake was piped through an eight-mile-long wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate the much needed electricity.&nbsp;A large portion of the building collapsed in 1992 under a heavy snow load. The Oregon National Guard, led by retired Command Sergeant Major Joe Batty, reconstructed the powerhouse and cabins from 1999 through 2005. The powerhouse contains pictures and artifacts from a bygone era.&nbsp; There is a local caretaker who gives tours when he is on site.</p>",

The facility is spread across 10 lovely acres and is perfect for large groups of up to 70 people or small family getaways.&nbsp;The buildings on the property were constructed from 1906 to 1936, and most structures are available for rent. A group picnic and camping area provide additional campsites and amenities for six RVs, plenty of room for tent camping, pathways to the river, and more.&nbsp;Snyder was originally constructed as a remote work station for early Forest Service employees. As roads were constructed and transportation improved, the site no longer required live-in crews, so visitors can now use these buildings as recreation rentals.</p><p><strong>Natural Features: </strong>Snyder Guard Station is located within the Lower Kootenai River Area (Bonners Ferry District) of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests. The area is bordered by the Purcell and Cabinet Ranges and the Montana Line on the east, the rugged Selkirk Range on the west, and the Canadian border to the north. The Kootenai River meanders north and west through the District, and the Moyie River joins it from the north.&nbsp;The Guard Station sits at an elevation of 2,500 feet along the Moyie River, 8 miles south of the Canadian border. Terrain in the river valley is relatively flat, and is bordered by Queen Mountain to the West and Ruby Mountain to the east.&nbsp;The mixed conifer forest include Douglas fir and spruce. Wildlife sightings include elk, deer, black bears, moose and bald eagles.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>Outdoor recreational opportunities abound on the Moyie River and nearby lakes.

The fully furnished three-room cabin is adjacent to the North Fork Coeur d&#39;Alene River on the Coeur d&#39;Alene River Ranger District in the Idaho Panhandle National Forests.&nbsp;<br /><br />The cabin was built between 1926 and 1928 to house Forest Service employees needed for administrative supervision and fire protection. It was built from a standard Forest Service plan known as the firemen&#39;s cabin. In 1935, a picnic area was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps across the road from the cabin and adjacent to the North Fork of the Coeur d&#39;Alene River. In 1940, a bathroom was added in a board and batten shed addition to the cabin&#39;s east side, and a rustic log garage was built behind the cabin. The cabin was used for crew housing until 1981.&nbsp;<br /><br />Newly renovated, the cabin is now fully accessible. Avery Cabin&#39;s central location along the North Fork Coeur d&#39;Alene River provides easy access to the site. Access to the cabin is along paved roadways, making it an easy destination to reach by car. The cabin is available from mid-May through September, and provides many of the comforts of home.

Rich in wildlife, the forest is home to large game such as elk and deer, as well as species such as grizzly bears, wolves and caribou that add to the sense of wildness.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>Guests can enjoy fishing for cutthroat or rainbow trout in the river.

The cabin was remodeled and modernized over the years. However, by the 1980s, the cabin fell into disuse. It now enjoys a second life as a rental cabin, providing a unique recreation opportunity for visitors to the Prescott National Forest.</p><p><br /><strong>Amenities</strong><br />The cabin has running water, a flush toilet, shower, electricity, and first aid kit. The kitchen has all the basic amenities including a sink, propane stove/oven, refrigerator, table and six chairs.

In 1863, Arizona's first Territorial Capital was established nearby at Del Rio Springs, and the surrounding area has experienced explosive growth since the town of Chino Valley was incorporated in 1970.</p><p><br />Watershed, wildlife and range management, dispersed recreation, and fuel wooding are programs emphasized by the District. Chino Valley is also very involved in managing the Upper Verde River Area, habitat of some sensitive and endangered species. Ashes, willows, and cottonwood trees are common vegetation types found along the river banks.<br />Although the Chino Valley Ranger District does not have developed recreation sites, dispersed recreation is allowed anywhere on forest unless posted otherwise. One of the most heavily used recreation areas on the west side of the District is Camp Wood, located in the pines at an elevation of 5,700 feet. Approximately one mile north of Camp Wood is a riparian area, Emerald Glade, which is host to a variety of wildlife. This area was created by a masonry silt retention structure as part of our forest's wildlife habitat improvement program. The popular camping areas on the east side of the District are along the headwaters of the Verde River. The most popular trail is Sycamore Trail, located in the Sycamore Canyon Wilderness.</p><p><br />In addition to Sycamore Canyon, three other wilderness areas are located within the district: Juniper Mesa Wilderness and Apache Creek Wilderness on the west side, Woodchute Wilderness on the east side.

Mount Union, in the Bradshaws, is the highest elevation on the forest, at nearly 8,000 feet. From 7,000 to 8,000 foot elevation along the Bradshaw Range, the vegetation changes from pure forests of ponderosa pine to mixed conifer forests of Douglas-fir and white fir. The weather throughout the Bradshaw District is moderate, with daytime temperatures averaging 50 degrees in the winter and 70 degrees in summer. Recreation opportunities abound throughout all seasons.</p><p><br />Granite Mountain Wilderness, the forest&#39;s only &quot;urban&quot; wilderness, is located just a few short miles from Prescott. Other scenic attractions include Thumb Butte, Lynx Lake and the Thumb Butte Loop, as well as drives to Palace Station and Crown King.

Drop a fishing line into the Verde River at one of eight day-use access points or put your canoe in at White Bridge Recreation Area for a popular nine-mile float to Beasley Flat. Explore the site of an old salt mine near Camp Verde, re-create history by following part of General Crook&rsquo;s military supply route, or book a stay at Sycamore Cabin, which once served as the ranger station for the old Bloody Basin Ranger District. ATV enthusiasts can enjoy off-road riding at Hayfield Draw.</p><p><br />For relief from summer&rsquo;s heat, follow the winding highway up to Mingus Mountain and camp in the pines at Potato Patch Campground or Mingus Recreation Area; groups of 20 to 100 can reserve Playground Group Campground. Many of the District&rsquo;s hiking trails are located on Mingus, but it&rsquo;s also a great place to relax and enjoy panoramic views of the Verde Valley. A bit lower on the mountain, near the cluster of homes known as Cherry, Powell Springs Campground stays open all year.</p><p><br />To escape from the crowds, try a backpacking trip into Pine Mountain or Cedar Bench wildernesses, on the southeastern edge of the District. Bring your own water and be prepared for an abundance of wildlife such as bears, mountain lions, and javelina. For more information, please contact the Verde Ranger District.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Information, permits, interpretive displays, LEED green building with solar panels and monitor, map sales, and free motor vehicle use maps for Prescott, Coconino, and Kaibab National Forests.</p>",

The District has approximately 25 people who manage a variety of traditional lands, fisheries, recreation and timber programs. Both the Wilderness and the recreation area receive high use, particularly during the summer season. Six developed campgrounds and a major visitor center, add to the heavy recreation program. The Ottawa Visitor Center is currently open year round with about 30,000 annual visitors.</p><p>Watersmeet is located in Michigan&#39;s Western Upper Peninsula, an area known for its woods and waters. This Headwaters area boasts beautiful, deep, clear, glacially formed lakes that provide water to the Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Mississippi Watersheds. Waterfalls are numerous and the major attractions to thousands of visitors annually.<br />The Watersmeet area is a perfect spot for fishing, picnicking, swimming, boating, canoeing, hiking, camping and hunting for grouse, black bear and white tailed deer. Tourism and timber products are the major industries in this area of forested hills and interspersed lakes and rivers. There are several resorts for those who wish to come to the Northwoods to stay in a comfortable cottage, or the Sylvania Wilderness for those wishing a more primitive experience in a pristine setting.<br />Watersmeet is in Big Snow Country where the rolling hills provide some of the best cross-country skiing in the mid-west. With snowfall averaging more than 100 inches a year, skiing usually begins in early December and sometimes doesn&#39;t end until after Easter. A half-dozen Alpine ski resorts are nearby - with Thanksgiving the declared opener for some. Major snowmobile trails cross the district and some trails even take the riders to view waterfalls in winter splendor<br />&nbsp;</p>",

The Irish Wilderness, caught in the middle of the Civil War, became a &ldquo;no man&rsquo;s land&rdquo; and was raided by both Union and Confederate troops as well as bushwhackers.
