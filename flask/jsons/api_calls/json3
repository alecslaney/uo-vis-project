Visitors will find foot travel across this pristine area challenging and often strenuous, but will be rewarded with spectacular scenery.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:</p><p>Dillon Reservoir, often referred to as Lake Dillon, is the greatest draw to this campground, offering 26.8 miles of shoreline. It is an ideal spot for fishing, boating, and sailing. Anglers will find that the reservoir supports a healthy population of rainbow and brown trout, with an occasional cutthroat trout finding its way into the lake from feeder streams.<br /><br />Opportunities for hiking and biking include more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail system.<br /><br />From the reservoir, the Old Dillon Reservoir trail is a favorite.

In 1905, the newly formed Forest Service was given authority of the reserve.<br /><br />Long before this designation, the area was home to the Ute Indians who followed herds of elk and bison on their seasonal migrations.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:</p><p>Encompassing a landscape of rivers, mountains, trails and forest roads, the White River National Forest is one of the top recreation forests in the nation.<br /><br />Located on the shores of Green Mountain reservoir, Cow Creek Campground is a popular spot for boating, canoeing, fishing, water skiing and windsurfing.<br /><br />Anglers will find populations of rainbow and brown trout, as well as kokanee salmon when casting their lines out into the water.<br /><br />Spring Creek is a popular off-roading area located at the northern end of the Gore Mountain Range. A network of roads open to off-road vehicle use meanders through lodgepole pine and spruce/fir forests.

The goals are to protect and preserve its natural resources and wilderness character and provide for public use. The Wilderness includes 5,160 acres at the northern end of the Uwharrie Mountains.</p><p>These mountains are considered to be the oldest on the North American Continent. Evidence of early Indians dates back over 12,000 years. The Catawba Indians&nbsp; inhabited the area when the Europeans began exploring the region in the late 1600&rsquo;s. By 1760 settlement had begun in earnest, opened up by the explorers and traders along the Ocaneechi Trail.</p><p>The Birkhead family raised a son, John Watson (Watt), who was born in 1858. The 3,000 acres that he acquired over the years were made up of many small tenant farms. Thus the mountain range became known locally as the Birkhead Mountains.</p><p>This old plantation is the core of the Wilderness. Remember, as you use the Wilderness, your challenge is to leave no trace of your passing. This will protect and preserve the area as true wilderness. Evidence of early Indians and settlers can often be found. These archeological and historic artifacts and sites hold clues to America&#39;s past. If disturbed , a part of our heritage is lost forever. Federal law protects such sites and artifacts on public land. If you discover such remains please leave them undisturbed.</p><p>All trails within the Wilderness are designated hiking trails. Travel by horse, motorized vehicle or bicycle is prohibited. A detailed map of the Wilderness is available at the District Ranger&rsquo;s Office.</p>",

Called the Broad River since 1745, the river once was a boundary between the Cherokee and Catawba Indian tribes. The river runs through a millrace at Lockhart leaving the riverbed virtually dry for more than a mile. The best points to get onto the river are five miles down river at the Broad River boat ramp or Woods Ferry Recreation area. The 16.6 mile float to Neal Shoals Dam is primarily flat-water with a few riffles. There is a small inlet to the river on the east bank where you can portage around the dam. Once around the dam the river passes under Highway 72/121 (no access). The Sandy River flows into the Broad from the east, and there is an access point just around the bend of the confluence. South of the Sandy River is the liveliest part of the trip. Riffles and ledges are present but the paddling is not difficult. The next landmark is Shelton Island, stay to the right channel. Henderson Island is next, a nice place to stop to take a break. The unusual stand of hardwoods covers a steep cove on the west bank. Take the left channel. As you travel under the bridge for Highway 34, you are leaving the forest.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd498216.pdf\">Click here</a><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5275650.pdf\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></a>for a printable guide and vicinity map.</p><p><strong>All&nbsp;boat landings on rivers, lakes and navigable waterways on the Francis Marion and Sumter National Forests are temporarily shut down effective April 2, 2020.</strong></p>",

This 5,350-acre impoundment of the Yadkin River was built in 1917 by the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) to generate hydroelectric power for the aluminum plant at Badin. The eastern shore borders the National Forest and the lake is well stocked with catfish, bream, largemouth, white and striped bass.</p><p>The Forest Service has one launching site at the Cove Boat Ramp. The State has two ramps on the lake. Marinas offer easy access for everything from jon-boats to pontoons. The lake is crowded with pleasure boats on spring and summer weekends. Well attended bass tournaments are usually held every weekend from March through October.</p><p>In early spring, fish are spawning and feeding well. Look for bluegill beds. These are circular depressions in the shallows. Catch them with crickets, worms or artificial bait. Fish along downed trees or stumps in the water for crappie and bass. Crappies will take minnows or jigs. For largemouth bass, you are going to have to work at it and try different lures. Look for largemouth around the rocky points.</p><p>Small spinners are always good for feeding bluegill. Fly rod experts can put a hurting on a bream bed. Most white bass anglers use a black and chartreuse jig rigged about three feet under a weighted bobber. This set-up takes crappie too. White bass and crappie are caught by the score, especially in the spring.</p><p>Carolina rigged plastic worms and lizards in assorted colors are local favorites for largemouth in the spring. Fishing live crawfish or minnows just off the bottom with a cork is an old fashioned, but effective, way to catch largemouth bass.

The background area is a lightly forested bedrock hillside with steep canyons and cliffs. During summer months, the area is a travel corridor for boats and aircraft, so cabin users should expect some noise. The following is included with the cabin: 2 single bunks, 2 double bunks (total capacity is 6 people), table, oil stove and tank, cooking counter, food cupboard and shelves, log book, broom and dustpan, picnic table, outhouse, 12&#39; x 20&#39; deck, ramp from beach, and a bucket. Water is available from a nearby stream. Treat all water before using. Bring your own fuel for the oil stove (#1 Stove oil), sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cooking stove, lantern, pots, pans, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, fire extinguisher, fire starter, insect repellant and bug nets. The cabin is heated by an oil stove, and cabin users requiring heat will be responsible for providing their own fuel. The type of fuel necessary is Number 1 stove oil. Fuel consumption is approximately 1 gallon per day with the stove on low setting (sufficient for 8 hours of heating with an outside temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit). The cabin and outhouse access ramp, deck, cabin door and furniture, picnic table and outhouse are wheelchair accessible. Assistance may be required to reach the ramp from the skiff landing site.</p>",

Special Features: There are excellent views of Clarence Strait and the adjacent islands. Cleveland Peninsula and Etolin Island lie across the strait to the east. The tidal community may include barnacles, mussels, clams, starfish, crab, abalone, and jelly fish. Many pleasant hours may be spent exploring the tidal area or \u201cbeach combing.\u201d The tides change every six and a half hours and during these changes there may be heavy currents. Orcas and humpback whales are frequently observed. Harbor seals and river otters may be in attendance from time to time also. Sitka black-tailed deer and black bear frequent the area in addition to other small furbearers. Waterfowl and sea birds may be observed. Bald eagles fish in the waters or scavenge along the shores. Flat to gently sloping easterly towards the strait. There are some drift logs on the beach, causing difficult access for the less agile. It is one of the few truly \"sandy\" beaches on Prince of Wales Island.    ",

The only way to see this magnificent cave is during the summer months, when visitors can take advantage of a no cost guided tour given by Forest Service employees. A locked gate guards the cave&#39;s entrance to protect against vandalism and possible damage from otherwise well-meaning individuals, as well as to keep inexperienced cavers safe from its hazards. The tour meets near the parking lot and outhouses and leads visitors on a somewhat strenuous 1,100 foot (335 m) hike up a long, steep stairway to an elevation of 250 feet and a platform at the mouth of the cave. The tour then proceeds inside the cave for approximately 500 feet and includes information about cave (karst) geology and archeological discoveries. The tour lasts approximately 2 hours. To reserve a cave tour call the Thorne Bay Ranger District at (907) 828-3304 at least 2 days in advance. Tour groups are limited in size to six people. Babies in packs or carriers are not allowed, nor are children under seven years of age. Precautions: The trail to the cave is strenuous and steep, with 367 stairs. There are no trails or lighting in the cave. Hazards include low ceilings, pits, and slippery, uneven ground. Footing is very uneven and only those with very sure footing and good agility should attempt the tour. What to bring: At least one flashlight per person, extra batteries, and sturdy footwear. Hard hats are required and are provided by the Forest Service at the site. Wear warm clothing as the cave temperature is a constant 40 degrees. Wet and muddy conditions are the norm.</p>",

The popularity of this picnic area lies in the accessibility to the Thorne River for fishing. Four species of salmon, rainbow and cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden, char, and spring and fall runs of steelhead occur in the Thorne River. Fly and drift fishing are effective in stream riffles and pools. Wild steelhead and some resident species are fragile in many waters throughout the area.

Please follow the oil stove directions carefully. Cabin users may also choose to bring a small outboard motor (less than 10 horsepower due to wilderness regulations). This is 1 of 2 cabins on the lake (the other is the South Young Lake cabin). You are in brown bear country. Bears frequent the area and trail particularly during salmon runs July through August. The Admiralty Cove-Young Lake trail is a 4&frac12; mile trail that departs from the cabin and ends at the Admiralty Cove cabin. It is a relatively flat trail and follows the creek at each end of the trail. The round trip hike can be fairly strenuous when conditions are very wet.

Mink, marten, and otter are also common along the island&rsquo;s shores, as are many varieties of birds. There are no black bears on Admiralty Island.</p><p>From its headwaters 4000 feet above sea level, Pack Creek descends rapidly to the saltwater of upper Seymour Canal. Sediment picked up by the creek is deposited at its mouth, creating a 400-acre mud flat. These flats are an important source of food for many animals, including bears, which feed on clams, shellfish, and other creatures.</p><p>Peak bear viewing on Pack Creek usually follows the return of pink and chum salmon, generally the first week of July. To protect the bears and other wilderness resources, <strong>a permit is required to visit Pack Creek between June 1 and September 10</strong>.

The Civilian Conservation Corps built the complex in 1931 as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal. It was one of 11 guard stations built in the area to serve as homes for rangers who patrolled the forest on horseback prior to the modern age of vehicles. The complex includes the guard station, bunkhouse, parking area, and fenced yard. The Ashley National Forest has chosen to rehabilitate and rent this guard station and bunkhouse to the public so that guests can enjoy a rustic experience similar to that of the first rangers.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The complex is&nbsp;set in a rolling pasture, surrounded and interspersed with aspen and pine trees. Wildlife and summer flowers are abundant during the use season.</span></p><p><span itemprop=\"description\"><strong>Nearby Attractions:</strong><br />Flaming Gorge Recreation Area is known not only for its beautiful red cliffs, but also for its world -class fishing for lake, brown, and rainbow trout. Boating, water skiing, canoeing, kayaking, swimming, and scuba diving are popular activities on the reservoirs. The dam is about 23 miles east of the complex. Sheep Creek Loop Scenic Backway (Geological Loop) is a 10 mile drive through spectacular canyon scenery and back in time. Millions of years of geologic history can be seen in a 20 minute drive, thanks to the Uinta Crest Fault and other rock features. The town of Manila is about 15 miles away, off the north end of Sheep Creek Loop where visitors can find grocery stores and other amenities.</span></p><p><span itemprop=\"description\">Included in this complex:<br />&bull;Broom ",

Navigate the waters and cast a rod in an adventure the whole family can enjoy. The Green River provides spectacular fishing and river-running opportunities, as well as unique geology, outlaw history and Native American rock art.</p><p>The Green River Float-In campsites contain 17 sites for river goers to float and camp along the mighty Green River. Some of these sites can be reached on foot but most of these sites can only be reached by boat.The campsites are nestled alongside the beautiful Green River in an area typical of a high desert environment. These sites are surrounded by shady juniper, cottonwood and ponderosa pine trees and during the summer various species of wildflowers dot the landscape.</p><p><b><i>Section &ldquo;A&rdquo; (Flaming Gorge Dam to Little hole Boat Launch) </i></b>The A section of the Green River begins just below the Flaming Gorge Dam and proceeds seven miles through a narrow breathtaking canyon to the Little Hole take-out. The towering red canyon cliffs, ponderosa pine, glassy clear water, abundant trout and rapids (class I and II) are what make section &quot;A&quot; of the Green River world famous. The Little Hole National Recreation Trail allows foot access to all 7 miles of this stretch of river.</p><p><b><i>Section &ldquo;B&rdquo; (Little Hole to Brown&rsquo;s Park) </i></b>It&rsquo;s a little more remote but that means there are a lot fewer people, if that&rsquo;s the experience you&rsquo;re looking for. Limited access in this section allows for healthy brown trout populations to thrive. There are 17 river camps in Section B that can be accessed only by hiking or floating in. Remember to reserve your site on the camp registration board at Little Hole or reserve certain sites in advance here o",

Surrounded by ancient muskegs and cathedral forests, the falls are relatively small but spectacular to see. Water cascades some 40 feet down to disappear into an adjacent cave. The cave itself is inaccessible and prone to sudden flooding. Before reaching the falls, you walk through muskegs that have taken thousands of years to develop to their present state. Decaying plants build a layer of peat that holds water like a giant sponge and gradually break down the surface of the karst to form caves. Visitors can pause at several points on the tour to see unique plant species including bog laurel, Labrador tea, and diminutive, ultra slow-growing shore pines that might be less than two feet high, yet 150 or more years old. You can also see features such as sinkholes, deep vertical pits, disappearing streams, and collapsed channels from the trail.",

The caldera stretches across&nbsp;17 square miles in the heart of the volcano. The 1,200 square mile volcano (about the size of Rhode Island) remains very active to this day. Newberry is both seismically and geothermally active. Geologists believe the caldera sits over a shallow magma body only 2 to 5 kilometers deep. Visitors see numerous cinder cones and vents (over 400 throughout the area), miles of basalt flows, as well as rhyolite flows of obsidian.</p><p>For up-to-date facts on Newberry Volcano, click ",

The resulting explosions formed a broad shallow crater, which later filled with water. North Twin has 112 surface acres, average depth of 40&rsquo;, and a maximum depth of 60 feet. The pine forests that ring North Twin are open at the beach and boat ramp on the north shore. The lake harbors healthy numbers of stocked rainbow trout and illegally introduced bullhead. Fishing for rainbow trout here can be very good with an average catch is 8 to 12 inches in length.</p><p>Locals do well angling near the shorelines early and late in the day using bait, flies, or lures. The best bait fishing is along the west shore in the deeper holes using red eggs, power bait, or marshmallows and worms suspended just off the bottom. Rooster Tails, Panther Martins, and dark flies trolled slowly or cast toward shore catch many fish. Fly-fishing is most effective near shore as there are some good hatches of mayflies, caddis, damsels, and flying ants. A boat or float tube is best for fishing on the lake, due to the limited space for back casts.</p><p><strong>Motorized boats are prohibited on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38940\">North Twin Boating Site</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

This 130-acre lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and supports planted rainbow trout average of 6 to12 inches, some brook trout, and self-sustaining populations of whitefish and tui chub. The fishing here is not as good as at Lava due to competition from the tui chub population. However, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife started control of the tui chub in 1997.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38918\">Little Lava Lake Boating Site</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

With good fishing for rainbow and brook trout, Little Cultus is a great place to take the family for a quiet weekend of fishing and camping. Rainbow trout angling, 11-17 inches are the primary fishery. Brook trout stocking ended in 1997 but some fish up to 16 inches are still found.</p><p>Little Cultus&#39; gently sloping shorelines are easily wadable. The deepest spots, up to 60 feet deep, are in the center of the lake. Angler&rsquo;s troll flashers with a trailing night crawler or use single lures, such as a gold Thomas lure or yellow Rooster Tail. Trolling slowly along drop-offs is a commonly used technique here. Bank fishing is best along the north shore of the lake, using bobbers and worms, spinners, spoons, or a marshmallow and worm fished near the bottom. The fish at Little Cultus Lake often surface feed on emerging damselflies and mayflies. Fly fishers should be well prepared with mayfly dries, ant imitations in sizes 10 to 14, damsel nymph imitations, and Woolly Buggers. Searching the shallower areas of the lake with wet flies, early and late in the day is especially effective.</p><p>Little Cultus Lake offers a quiet, wooded area with primitive camping. Road surfaces are dirt or gravel. Little Cultus Campground, on the southeast comer of the lake, charges a fee and has a picnic area, outhouses, a hand pump for drinking water, and a paved boat ramp.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38908\">Little Cultus Boating Site</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Lava Lake is relatively old as evidenced by the extrusive vegetation occurring in the shallow areas. Rushes, waterlilies and other emergent plants are especially evident on the west and northern perimeter. Another indication of the lake&rsquo;s aging is the 4 to 5 feet deep layer of muck located on the lake bottom as reported by divers.</p><p>Subsurface springs provide the primary inflow to Lava Lake. The springs are located in the northeast corner of the lake at a depth of 20 to 30 feet. Water temperatures from the inflow vary between 45&deg; to 60&deg; F. There are no permanent surface streams entering the lake, however, intermittent seeps do enter the lake from Wire Meadow. &nbsp;Lava Lake connects with Little Lava Lake only occasionally during periods of spring high water. The outlet channel is located in the southeast corner of the lake. Water level fluctuates an average of approximately 2.5 feet annually with maximum pool occurring in late summer. Timing of the peak pool level is consistent with flow levels typical of springs in the area.</p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38896\">Lava Lake Boating Site</a>, &nbsp;and Lava Lake Resort.</p>",

This large lake is 3562 acres, 6 miles long and 1 1/2 miles wide, and reaches a depth of 282 ft. The average depth is 132 ft. which makes it ideal habitat for lake trout (Mackinaw) and bull trout. Rainbow trout, kokanee salmon and whitefish also naturally reproduce in this lake. Odell Lake is managed as a trophy lake trout fishery and has the distinction of the last two state record lake trout being caught here. The current state record is a 40 lb 8 oz 45.5 inch long giant caught in 1984 by Kenneth Erickson. Bull trout is listed as a threatened species with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and is thus closed to angling.</p><p>Odell Lake also offers beautiful campsites tucked away in thick forests and some excellent wind surfing.

The trail provides access for fishing piers. The Silver Lake Boardwalk accesses the Brighton Lakes Trail. The visitor&#39;s center has restrooms and a drinking fountain. Construction for an outdoor restroom facility was started Summer 1999 and should be completed for the 2000 season. Please be cautious of moose that live in the area. Do not approach any moose you may encounter on or near trails. Moose may seem calm and tame, but they are not! Moose are wild and unpredictable. For your own safety, please avoid these animals. Please do not pick any wildflowers. Picking wildflowers prevents them from blooming the following year. Please leave them so that others may enjoy them!</p>",

The Newberry Caldera encircles the basins of Paulina and East lakes and it is nearly 5 miles (8 km) in diameter. This collapsed <em>caldera&nbsp;</em>is the result of more than 500,000 years of volcanic activity. Neither lake receives water from an inlet stream. Both lakes rely on rain, snowmelt, and hot springs for water. Although these lakes are twins and share much in common, they are not at all identical.</p><p>Paulina Lake, the larger twin, is the deepest at 250 feet (76 m). Paulina Creek drains this lake and has chiseled a narrow gorge through the caldera&#39;s west wall creating a remarkable twin waterfall. Thermal vents and hot springs along the lake&#39;s northeast edge help create a highly productive ecosystem. The lake fed by snowmelt, hot springs, and groundwater flows from East Lake. The outlet stream from the lake is Paulina Creek that flows westward into the Little Deschutes River. The lake covers an area of 1531 acres. The average depth of the lake is 163 feet with a maximum depth of 250 feet.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38446\">Paulina Lake Day Use Area</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38402\">Little Crater Boating Site&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and Paulina Lake Resort.</p><p>Click here for information on <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5447133.docx\">Paulina Hot Springs</a>.</p>",

The outlet stream from the lake flows northward and is joined by two other streams to form Three Creek. The lake is surrounded by old growth forest, and is easy to fish from shore; however, fishing from a boat is the most popular method. The lake elevation is 6,550 feet; it is an alpine gem resting at the base of Tam McArthur Rim south of Sisters. This 28-acre lake has planted rainbow trout and a self-sustaining population of brook trout, ranging from 8 to 15 inches. Most catches average around 10 inches. Trolling flies and lures, fishing from shore, and still-fishing with bait are all successfully used methods.</p><p>The shoreline of Three Creek Lake varies from gentle slope to rocky cliff, surrounded by old growth forest. Maximum depth is 28 feet down the center and near the cliff on the south end of the lake. Most of the lake is easy to fish from shore or by wading, but fishing from a boat is by far the most popular method. Motors are not allowed on Three Creek Lake, contributing to the serenity of the setting. There is a primitive boat ramp on the east shore as well as a small store that rents boats.</p><p><strong>Motorized boats are prohibited on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There is a primitive boat ramp on east shore near the store.</p>",

Like the Baird Glacier, it is a western outlet of the Stikine Icefield. This 14- mile long glacier does not reach tidewater. Instead it flows into the 2- mile long Patterson Lake, then Patterson River, and eventually into Thomas Bay. Due to rapid glacial retreat over the past thirty years, Patterson Lake has grown large enough for floatplanes to land, thus greatly increasing the recreation potential of this area. The Patterson Glacier is losing ice at a rate of about 135 feet per year at the terminus, so icebergs can be seen in the lake. There are no recreation facilities&nbsp;such as cabins or shelters at the glacier, though other FS cabins such as <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79040&amp;actid=101\"><strong>Spurt Cove</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78998&amp;actid=101\"><strong>Cascade Creek</strong></a> are nearby in Thomas Bay.

However, visitors can hike several miles along an old logging road on the north side of the river (and south of Delta Creek) to reach an area close to the lake.

The lake is one of two exceptional trout lakes nestled in the caldera of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument, the largest ice-age volcano in Oregon. In addition to fishing for kokanee, rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, chub, and brown trout, people come to this lake to picnic and camp. East Lake shares this outstanding geologic area with Paulina Lake and both lakes are well known for their large brown trout. East lake is one of the finest and most traditional fisheries in Oregon, regularly producing brown trout over 10 pounds. The lake record for brown trout is a 22.5 pounds. Brown. Rainbow trout are also popular using all kinds of angling techniques. East Lake is 6,381 feet above sea level, is approximately a mile in diameter, and the average depth is just over 67 feet. The lake is fed by snowmelt and underground springs.</p><p>Covering over 500 square miles, Newberry Volcano is one of the largest shield volcanoes in the lower 48 states. The area was named after J. S. Newberry, a scientist attached to the 1853 railroad surveying party. The volcano&#39;s summit contains a seventeen square mile caldera, also referred to as Newberry Crater, formed as the top of the volcano collapsed when the magma chamber beneath emptied out. The caldera may have Originally contained one large lake, like Crater Lake. However, more recent eruptions divided the crater into two crystal clear lakes, separated by pumice, ash, and lava flows.</p><p><strong>Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on this body of water.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For boat launch information see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fs.usda.gov/recarea/38348\">East Lake Boating Site</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fs.usda.gov/r",
