Please follow the oil stove directions carefully. You are in brown bear country. Bears frequent the area and trail particularly during salmon runs July through August. In addition to fishing, popular activities include wildlife viewing (brown bear, deer, and waterfowl can often be seen in the nearby area), berry picking and beach combing. The Admiralty Cove-Young Lake trail is a 4&frac12; mile trail that departs from the cabin and ends at the North Young Lake cabin. It is a relatively flat trail and follows the creek at each end of the trail. The round trip hike can be fairly strenuous when conditions are very wet.</p>",

The cabin sits 10&#39; (3 m) from the lake shore with no beach. Water is available from the lake or creek. Treat all water before using. Bring your own personal flotation devices, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cooking stove, lantern, pots, pans, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, fire extinguisher, and fire starter. Cabin users may also choose to bring a small outboard motor (less than 10 horsepower due to wilderness regulations). You are in brown bear country. Brown bear and deer may be seen in the area; good fishing can be found at the nearby lake outlet. This is 1 of 3 cabins on Hasselborg Lake (the other two are Big Shaheen and Little Shaheen). The lake is very popular and has a lot of float plane traffic. Trails to Hasselborg Creek and Guerin Lake depart from the cabin, going to the Hasselborg Lake shelter as well. The lake is 7 miles (11 km) long and part of the Cross Admiralty Canoe route.</p><p><strong>Firewood is generally stacked in a woodshed near the cabin, but it is not guaranteed.</strong></p>",

It encompasses 12,300 acres of tundra and spruce/fir forest in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in Grand County, Colorado. Edward Berthoud named Vasquez Peak, the highest point in the Wilderness at 12,947 feet. Berthoud was the founder and engineer of the mountain pass through the Rocky Mountains into the Middle Park area of Colorado, now known as Berthoud Pass.</p><p>The Vasquez Peak Wilderness is bordered by the Winter Park Ski Area to the north; the Fraser Experimental Forest to the west; Berthoud Pass (Highway 40) road to the east; and Jones Pass and the Henderson Mine to the south. This high country Wilderness sits entirely above 10,000 feet with over half of its area above timberline.</p><p>There are over 15 miles of trail across the alpine tundra and only one trail that climbs through a spruce/fir forest. These trails lead up to two small lakes, across six peaks above 12,500 feet in elevation, and above numerous small creeks that start in high alpine basins. Along the southern boundary of Vasquez Peak Wilderness the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail offers opportunities for solitude and views.</p><p>With much of the trail system above timberline, sudden summer thunderstorms can make exposure to lightning in the Vasquez Mountains a dangerous risk. Plan on hiking early and dropping into the trees before afternoon storms break. In winter, avalanches are common.</p><p>Always use&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lnt.org/learn/7-principles%22\" target=\"-blank\">Leave No Trace</a>&nbsp;techniques to help keep this area wild, clean, and pristine.</p>",

The only way to see this magnificent cave is during the summer months, when visitors can take advantage of a no cost guided tour given by Forest Service employees. A locked gate guards the cave&#39;s entrance to protect against vandalism and possible damage from otherwise well-meaning individuals, as well as to keep inexperienced cavers safe from its hazards. The tour meets near the parking lot and outhouses and leads visitors on a somewhat strenuous 1,100 foot (335 m) hike up a long, steep stairway to an elevation of 250 feet and a platform at the mouth of the cave. The tour then proceeds inside the cave for approximately 500 feet and includes information about cave (karst) geology and archeological discoveries. The tour lasts approximately 2 hours. To reserve a cave tour call the Thorne Bay Ranger District at (907) 828-3304 at least 2 days in advance. Tour groups are limited in size to six people. Babies in packs or carriers are not allowed, nor are children under seven years of age. Precautions: The trail to the cave is strenuous and steep, with 367 stairs. There are no trails or lighting in the cave. Hazards include low ceilings, pits, and slippery, uneven ground. Footing is very uneven and only those with very sure footing and good agility should attempt the tour. What to bring: At least one flashlight per person, extra batteries, and sturdy footwear. Hard hats are required and are provided by the Forest Service at the site. Wear warm clothing as the cave temperature is a constant 40 degrees. Wet and muddy conditions are the norm.</p>",

This is one of the favorite spots for fishing access to Gravelly Creek and the Thorne River and provides excellent fishing opportunities. There is a short ADA accessible trail from the paved parking area to the picnic sites and river. Special Features: Sitka black-tailed deer and black bear inhabit the area, along with other small fur bearers. Waterfowl, seabirds, bald eagles and other birds may be observed. The popularity of this picnic area lies in the accessibility to the Thorne River for fishing. Four species of salmon, rainbow and cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden, char, and spring and fall runs of steelhead occur in the Thorne River. Fly and drift fishing are effective in stream riffles and pools. Wild steelhead and some resident species are fragile in many waters throughout the area.

Special Features: There are excellent views of Clarence Strait and the adjacent islands. Cleveland Peninsula and Etolin Island lie across the strait to the east. The tidal community may include barnacles, mussels, clams, starfish, crab, abalone, and jelly fish. Many pleasant hours may be spent exploring the tidal area or \u201cbeach combing.\u201d The tides change every six and a half hours and during these changes there may be heavy currents. Orcas and humpback whales are frequently observed. Harbor seals and river otters may be in attendance from time to time also. Sitka black-tailed deer and black bear frequent the area in addition to other small furbearers. Waterfowl and sea birds may be observed. Bald eagles fish in the waters or scavenge along the shores. Flat to gently sloping easterly towards the strait. There are some drift logs on the beach, causing difficult access for the less agile.

Surrounded by ancient muskegs and cathedral forests, the falls are relatively small but spectacular to see. Water cascades some 40 feet down to disappear into an adjacent cave. The cave itself is inaccessible and prone to sudden flooding. Before reaching the falls, you walk through muskegs that have taken thousands of years to develop to their present state. Decaying plants build a layer of peat that holds water like a giant sponge and gradually break down the surface of the karst to form caves. Visitors can pause at several points on the tour to see unique plant species including bog laurel, Labrador tea, and diminutive, ultra slow-growing shore pines that might be less than two feet high, yet 150 or more years old. You can also see features such as sinkholes, deep vertical pits, disappearing streams, and collapsed channels from the trail.",

The background area is a lightly forested bedrock hillside with steep canyons and cliffs. During summer months, the area is a travel corridor for boats and aircraft, so cabin users should expect some noise. The following is included with the cabin: 2 single bunks, 2 double bunks (total capacity is 6 people), table, oil stove and tank, cooking counter, food cupboard and shelves, log book, broom and dustpan, picnic table, outhouse, 12&#39; x 20&#39; deck, ramp from beach, and a bucket. Water is available from a nearby stream. Treat all water before using. Bring your own fuel for the oil stove (#1 Stove oil), sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cooking stove, lantern, pots, pans, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, fire extinguisher, fire starter, insect repellant and bug nets. The cabin is heated by an oil stove, and cabin users requiring heat will be responsible for providing their own fuel. The type of fuel necessary is Number 1 stove oil. Fuel consumption is approximately 1 gallon per day with the stove on low setting (sufficient for 8 hours of heating with an outside temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit). The cabin and outhouse access ramp, deck, cabin door and furniture, picnic table and outhouse are wheelchair accessible.

The Hiking Trail offers visitors access to the Harris River for wildlife viewing and fishing. The trail is gravel tread for a majority of the way, with one small creek ford and one deep river ford making the trail way at times impassable after approximately one mile. The other one mile of the trail is accessible from the Hydaburg Highway and features gravel tread and three wooden bridges, with excellent fishing access.  Both sides of the trail pass through a second growth spruce and hemlock forest with alder trees immediately in the foreground and glimpses of Harris Ridge in the background. The Harris River supports an abundant run of chum, coho and sockeye salmon as well as steelhead and cutthroat trout. Waterfowl and bald eagles are commonly seen in the area during spawning season.",

See flat bottomlands, high-alpine conifers, red rock formations, gray sandstone cliffs and salt flats all in the same day. Sights include Devil&#39;s Kitchen, Walker Flat and Mt. Nebo Wilderness. This well-signed Byway is a winding drive between the cities of Payson and Nephi. The road climbs 9,000 feet and crosses the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest providing stunning views of Utah Valley, the surrounding Wasatch, and the dramatic wrap-around vistas of Mt. Nebo, the highest peak in the rugged and beautiful Wasatch Range. Nebo Loop is designated a National Scenic Byway by the Federal Highway Administration, recognizing it as one of the premier driving roads in America. Thy Byway is a photographers dream with many overlooks and wildlife viewing opportunities. The brilliant fall foliage of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest is hard to match anywhere in the nation. Along the way, there are numerous campgrounds, trail systems and popular horseback riding areas. A unique scenic feature is Devils Kitchen Geologic Interest Site with picnic facilities, a paved trail and observation deck. The eroded sandstone formation&#39;s startling red color adds contrast to the mountain greenery found through the rest of the Byway. Devil&#39;s Kitchen Geological Area can be found along the loop, just 6 miles from Bear Canyon. It offers a 1/2-mile round-trip trail to interesting red rock hoodoos. The Payson Lakes Recreation Area, 12 miles south of Payson, offers hiking on paved trails, improved picnic areas, camping and excellent fishing. The Byway also provides trail access to the Mount Nebo Wilderness Area.</p>",

Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan.

Downriver, below the campground and Ruedi Dam, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the &quot;toilet bowl.&quot; Here, the fish feed on mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake.<br /><br />The stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife Commission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of 2 fish over 14 inches.&nbsp;<br /><br />Chapman Reservoir is also an option for anglers wanting to cast lines in at its shore.

A curving boardwalk winds through the cool streamside forest, allowing one to stop and rest or fish at the fishing pier. In this forest, you will see some of the state&rsquo;s largest and oldest white pine and hemlock trees.</p><p><strong>Surrounding area: </strong>Visitors who want to stay longer may like to see the adjacent <a href=\"http://hatcheries.dnr.sc.gov/walhalla/index.html\">Walhalla State Fish Hatchery</a>. Witness the <a href=\"http://www.dnr.sc.gov/\">South Carolina Department of Natural Resources</a> fisheries management practices as fish swim the runs. More than 200,000 pounds of brown and rainbow trout are produced each year to stock the Chattooga River, Lake Jocassee and many streams in Oconee, Pickens and Greenville counties.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a more serene environment, visit Ellicot Rock Wilderness next to the picnic area.

Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:</p><p>Renowned for its fly fishing, Fryingpan River flows below Ruedi Dam. Here, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the &quot;toilet bowl.&quot; The fish feed on Mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake.</p><p>The stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife Commission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of 2 fish over 14 inches.</p><p>For hikers and bikers, the Ruedi Trail, located north of the reservoir, climbs to the top of Red Table Mountain. The trailhead is located 200 feet north of the Jeep trail near the boat ramp and parking lot. This 8-mile trail gains over 3,000 feet in elevation, leading hikers to a spectacular panoramic view of the area.</p><p>Boating, swimming, and water skiing are all possible in the area.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>:</p><p>Dearhamer Campground has 13 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers, and RVs.

As many as 80 visitors stayed in the house at one time when the Chattooga River, just up the road, was too deep to cross. The self-sufficient farmstead included ten outbuildings clustered around the main house. Many of life&rsquo;s necessities were made in the sheds and the blacksmith shop. The spring house provided drinking water and served as a refrigerator. A fire destroyed the main house and three outbuildings in 1988, leaving only a chimney of the main house.

Flat Tops is Colorado&#39;s second largest Wilderness, a precious expanse of open land.</p><p>The White River National Forest has a longstanding tradition of promoting wilderness stewardship.&nbsp; In 1919, Arthur Carhart, a Forest Service landscape architect, realized the uniqueness of the location when he stood on the shoreline of Trappers Lake. Carhart&rsquo;s task was to survey the area to build a recreational housing development of summer cottages. However, what Carhart saw and experienced at Trappers Lake compelled him to strongly recommend to his supervisors that the area remain undeveloped. Flat Tops, also known as the &ldquo;Cradle of Wilderness,&rdquo; is where the idea of wilderness was first applied to public land.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s no wonder Carhart found the area so entrancing: behind Trappers Lake loom steep volcanic cliffs and beyond them a vast subalpine terrain yields to alpine tundra.&nbsp; The Flat Tops are part of the White River Plateau with an average elevation of about 10,000 feet. Approximately 110 lakes and ponds, often unnamed, dot the country above and below numerous flat-topped cliffs. Roughly 100 miles of fishable streams are in the Wilderness.</p><p>The valleys and relatively gentle land above the cliffs offers over 160 miles of trails. Thousands of recrea",

The best points to get onto the river are five miles down river at the Broad River boat ramp or Woods Ferry Recreation area. The 16.6 mile float to Neal Shoals Dam is primarily flat-water with a few riffles. There is a small inlet to the river on the east bank where you can portage around the dam. Once around the dam the river passes under Highway 72/121 (no access). The Sandy River flows into the Broad from the east, and there is an access point just around the bend of the confluence. South of the Sandy River is the liveliest part of the trip. Riffles and ledges are present but the paddling is not difficult. The next landmark is Shelton Island, stay to the right channel. Henderson Island is next, a nice place to stop to take a break. The unusual stand of hardwoods covers a steep cove on the west bank. Take the left channel.

Located on Fires Creek, Bristol Campground has nine sites, a vault toilet, and accomodates horse campers. Huskins Branch Hunters Camp offers primitive camping. From the Leatherwood Falls Picnic Area, a 0.7-mile loop goes to Leatherwood Falls.</p>",

The Ranger Station is the second oldest building of its kind in the United States, having been built in 1910. James Cayton and his wife Birdie (a school teacher) built the cabin and were the first individuals to live in the structure. In addition to serving as James and Birdie&rsquo;s home, the station functioned as the headquarters for managing what was then known as the Grand River Ranger District on the Battlement National Forest. James and Birdie conducted a variety of official activities while living and working at the Ranger Station, including: surveying boundaries, posting signs, building and repairing telephone lines, inspecting homestead claims, monitoring ranchers&rsquo; cattle, selling hunting licenses, and looking after the station&rsquo;s garden and livestock.</p><p style=\"margin: 1em 0px;\">The Cayton Ranger Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Today, visitors can interact with and learn about the Station in a variety of ways. Visitors can take a hike up Cayton Gulch, explore the grounds, or enjoy a picnic near the Station. Visitors can also look inside the interior of the cabin, which is still decorated as it appeared when James and Birdie lived on site. Interpretive brochures and posters available outside the Station provide information about the lives of James and Birdie, as well as the history of the structure.</p><p style=\"margin: 1em 0px;\">The Forest Service manages this site in partnership with the Cayton Ranger Station Foundation. The Station is available for special events, and the Foundation also periodically hosts interpretive programming on the grounds. ",

In 1905, the newly formed Forest Service was given authority of the reserve.<br /><br />Long before this designation, the area was home to the Ute Indians who followed herds of elk and bison on their seasonal migrations.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:</p><p>Encompassing a landscape of rivers, mountains, trails and forest roads, the White River National Forest is one of the top recreation forests in the nation.<br /><br />Located on the shores of Green Mountain reservoir, Cow Creek Campground is a popular spot for boating, canoeing, fishing, water skiing and windsurfing.<br /><br />Anglers will find populations of rainbow and brown trout, as well as kokanee salmon when casting their lines out into the water.<br /><br />Spring Creek is a popular off-roading area located at the northern end of the Gore Mountain Range. A network of roads open to off-road vehicle use meanders through lodgepole pine and spruce/fir forests. Viewpoints of surrounding mountains open up along these roads.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>:</p><p>Cow Creek South Campground has 44 standard sites suitable for tents, trailers and RVs.

The goals are to protect and preserve its natural resources and wilderness character and provide for public use. The Wilderness includes 5,160 acres at the northern end of the Uwharrie Mountains.</p><p>These mountains are considered to be the oldest on the North American Continent. Evidence of early Indians dates back over 12,000 years. The Catawba Indians&nbsp; inhabited the area when the Europeans began exploring the region in the late 1600&rsquo;s. By 1760 settlement had begun in earnest, opened up by the explorers and traders along the Ocaneechi Trail.</p><p>The Birkhead family raised a son, John Watson (Watt), who was born in 1858. The 3,000 acres that he acquired over the years were made up of many small tenant farms. Thus the mountain range became known locally as the Birkhead Mountains.</p><p>This old plantation is the core of the Wilderness. Remember, as you use the Wilderness, your challenge is to leave no trace of your passing. This will protect and preserve the area as true wilderness. Evidence of early Indians and settlers can often be found. These archeological and historic artifacts and sites hold clues to America&#39;s past. If disturbed , a part of our heritage is lost forever. Federal law protects such sites and artifacts on public land. If you discover such remains please leave them undisturbed.</p><p>All trails within the Wilderness are designated hiking trails. Travel by horse, motorized vehicle or bicycle is prohibited.

This 5,350-acre impoundment of the Yadkin River was built in 1917 by the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) to generate hydroelectric power for the aluminum plant at Badin. The eastern shore borders the National Forest and the lake is well stocked with catfish, bream, largemouth, white and striped bass.</p><p>The Forest Service has one launching site at the Cove Boat Ramp. The State has two ramps on the lake. Marinas offer easy access for everything from jon-boats to pontoons. The lake is crowded with pleasure boats on spring and summer weekends. Well attended bass tournaments are usually held every weekend from March through October.</p><p>In early spring, fish are spawning and feeding well. Look for bluegill beds. These are circular depressions in the shallows. Catch them with crickets, worms or artificial bait. Fish along downed trees or stumps in the water for crappie and bass. Crappies will take minnows or jigs. For largemouth bass, you are going to have to work at it and try different lures. Look for largemouth around the rocky points.</p><p>Small spinners are always good for feeding bluegill. Fly rod experts can put a hurting on a bream bed. Most white bass anglers use a black and chartreuse jig rigged about three feet under a weighted bobber. This set-up takes crappie too. White bass and crappie are caught by the score, especially in the spring.</p><p>Carolina rigged plastic worms and lizards in assorted colors are local favorites for largemouth in the spring. Fishing live crawfish or minnows just off the bottom with a cork is an old fashioned, but effective, way to catch largemouth bass.

Visitors will find foot travel across this pristine area challenging and often strenuous, but will be rewarded with spectacular scenery.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:</p><p>Dillon Reservoir, often referred to as Lake Dillon, is the greatest draw to this campground, offering 26.8 miles of shoreline.

At dinner, take a guided ski adventure by miner&rsquo;s light or a romantic sleigh ride to the Cookhouse, then enjoy such legendary traditions as Porcini Dusted Elk or Jack Daniels Marinated Caribou. Wild game doesn&rsquo;t appeal? The wild Alaskan Salmon, Rainbow Trout, and vegetarian specials will please the most finicky palette.Serving lunch daily noon to 2:00 p.m., and d inner nightly arrival time 6:30 p.m. to ski or sleigh to the Cookhouse Reservation Hotline: 970-925-1044; King Cabin Ski Hut:970- 925-1971 www.pinecreekcookhouse.com</p>",

They leased property for grazing, including the dunes along ocean beaches.</p><p>In 1954 they took a group of horses to the dunes. One horse was a year-old filly. A year later, when the Petersons weren&rsquo;t able to use that area any longer, they rounded up the horses to transport them to another place. As the animals were being herded into a corral, the filly, then two years old, jumped over the eight-foot fence and ran into the dunes.</p><p>The Petersons tried many times to catch her, even using relay teams to run her down, but she always escaped. After an announcement that anyone could have the horse if they could catch her, other people tried. But her brown coloring was good camouflage and her splayed hoofs enabled her to run through woods, water, wet sand, and steep-sided dunes.</p><p>Known as the Wild Mare,",

All 6 campsites have views up the Pine River Valley. Private land is adjacent, with no public access to the river until three miles up the trail. Campsites accommodate only tents or small RVs. The Pine River Trail crosses private land for 3 miles before reaching the Weminuche Wilderness. Respect private property, and leave gates as you find them. The trail is very popular with horseback riders and follows the Pine River for 6 miles to intersect with the Lake Creek Trail, which leads steeply uphill to Emerald Lake.

You&#39;ll need to travel cross country using a map and compass - a real wilderness experience.</p><p>Pristine rain forest canyons run with crystalline water pouring into either Rock Creek itself in the heart of the Wilderness or Big Creek on the southern boundary. Mossy big leaf maple and red alder hang suspended over both creeks as they make their way toward the salty waves of the Pacific Ocean. Near the coast, tremendous old-growth Sitka spruce sometimes reach nine feet in diameter, giving way to old Douglas fir farther inland. Pink-blossomed rhododendron bloom in May, joining salal, salmonberry, and sword fern in their efforts to keep the ground perpetually shaded.</p><p>Look carefully for Oregon Silverspot butterflies on the tall ridge between Rock and Big Creeks; these orange-and-brown butterflies live only here and in two other places on earth. Salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat trout migrate up creek to spawn.</p><p>Fog cools the area almost all of every summer; and winters are usually snow free.</p><p><style type=\"text/css\">.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 80%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;} small{position: absolute; z-index: 40; bottom: 0; margin-bottom: -15px;}</style></p><div class=\"embed-container\"><small><a href=\"//usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=51f650f63d534c7a9d8f76c8faf3fd40&amp;extent=-124.1026,44.1506,-123.9825,44.2127&amp;home=true&amp;zoom=true&amp;scale=true&amp;legend=true&amp;basemap_gallery=true&amp;disable_scroll=true&amp;theme=light\" style=\"color:#0000FF;text-align:left\" target=\"_blank\">View larger map</a></small><br /><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=51f650f63d534c7a9d8f76c8faf3fd40&amp;ex",

The campground is 6 miles west of Durango Mountain Resort on the Hermosa Park Rd. (Forest Rd. 578), accessible by 2WD. Much of this gravel road follows the route of the Scotch Creek Toll Road, which ran from Rico to the Animas Valley in the late 1800s. The road continues over Bolam Pass to Colorado Highway 145 north of Rico. The upper section is 4WD only.The upper trailhead for the Hermosa Creek Trail begins 2 miles past the campground, near the confluence of the main and east forks of Hermosa Creek. This multiple-use trail heads back to the town of Hermosa through the Hermosa Roadless Area. The trail offers a technical single-track experience for mountain bikes (at 19 miles, taking most of a day, including shuttle drops). A few camping sites are available at the trailhead, which has a toilet, picnic tables, fire grates, corral, and parking area.</p>",

A few are next to the creek, and some have large parking areas. The Ice Lake Basin Trail, a strenuous, steep, and popular hike, begins across the road from the campground. It leads up above timberline to high alpine lakes surrounded by meadows of wildflowers and rocky peaks. Please stay on the trail to avoid steep, dangerous dropoffs. Dispersed camping along Forest Rd. 585 is allowed only in designated camping areas. Follow posted directions and instructions. The road to the campground is drivable by 2WD, but not far after the campground, it becomes 4WD. Driving off- road is prohibited, but many other 4WD roads in the Silverton area are open to motorized use.</p>",

Take in great views of the dunes and Pacific Ocean from wheel-chair accessible viewing platforms or hike through the dunes and coastal forest to the ocean. As one of the several areas of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area that is closed to Off Highway Vehicles (OHVs), dune explorers will find exceptional hiking from the dunes&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/siuslaw/?cid=fsbdev7_007155\">transition forest</a> to the beach and sand.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recreation/recarea/?recid=42469\">Oregon Dunes Loop Trail</a> is paved for the first half-mile to a viewing area. From there the trail takes visitors down into the dunes. There are two main hiking options. The popular 2-mile round-trip out to the beach and back follows a fairly-level and hard-packed trail through the sand to the beach. Those who want a longer hike and more solitude can follow the trail to the beach then walk south along the beach for about 1.5 miles to the exit point back through the dunes. The trail follows large post markers through deep sand.</p><p>During the summer months, ranger-led talks are available most days at the Oregon Dunes Day Use Area and guided hikes are available most weekends. Jr. Ranger evening programs are also held at different locations throughout the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.

The trail passes through dense forests of standing dead trees, killed or weakened by either the fire or bark beetle infestation. For example, over two weeks in June, a district trail crew cleared approximately 250 dead and downed trees lying across the first five miles of the trail between the trailhead and hot springs.</p><p>About half of the West Fork Trail between the trailhead and hot springs is impacted and may pose safety issues, and conditions currently make travel by pack animals dangerous in certain sections. One portion of the trail near the hot springs is washed out and not recommended for stock travel at this time. Wilderness crews plan to work on this section this month to try to improve conditions. In addition, burned-out stumps have left multiple large holes along one mile of the trail between the first two bridge crossings, also making stock travel treacherous and foot travel difficult. The bridges, however, are in good shape, although one bridge did sustain damage from a falling dead tree. Its hand rails have been rebuilt and the bridge inspected.</p><p>Visitors are also reminded that camping near the hot springs can be dangerous because the root systems of the multiple standing dead trees in the area may not be intact and are very susceptible to wind throw. Past the hot springs, Forest Service crews have cleared standing dead trees along switchbacks, but at the top of the pass, the trail is washed out and deemed impassable to stock travel. In addition, crews have not yet cleared downed trees across the trail past the switchbacks.</p>",

Parts of the town are private property, so pack out all your trash and observe posted trespassing signs.  Stunner Campground is beside the Alamosa River 2 miles below the top of Stunner Pass. There are 10 campsites with tables, fireplaces, vault type toilet, ample parking and a developed water system operated with a hand pump. Firewood is limited. Convenient trailer spaces available. The Alamosa River is nearby for fishing, unfortunately, naturally acidic water severely limits fishing in the Alamosa River between Stunner Campground and Terrace Reservoir. Big game hunting is possible. Stunner is a ghost town of historic significance. Please pack your trash. Obtain permission before entering any private property in the area.  Stunner, never very big, has long been a ghost town with ghost mines on both sides of the Alamosa. The names of its mines have a special flavor -- the Orpheus, Cornucopia, the Merrimac, Log Cabin, and Snow Storm, and as always, a mine named for a wife, daughter or sweetheart, the Louise. Only those mines north of the river shipped payable ore; those south, shipped no ore. Stunner, like the Platoro camp south across the mountain to the left, had transportation problems. The government road had washed out by 1885 and was not repaired because of the discontinuance of the forts at Fort Garland and at Pagosa Springs, and the construction of a railroad over Cumbres Pass to the south. This meant mail was delivered by pack trains and post riders in the summer and on skis in the winter.  The ink-blue, fringed gentians bloom in the meadow in late August.

Its location in the central Columbia River Gorge makes it a a convenient basecamp for the Gorge&#39;s many outdoor adventures and historic sites. Like most Gorge campsites, it is near a railroad and interstate so campers should expect some background noise.&nbsp;</p><p>No hookups are available, but there is potable water onsite. Only small trailers and RVs, less than&nbsp;30 feet overall in length fit, so the campsites are best suited for tent camping.</p><p>From the campsite, visitors can day hike the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=29920&amp;actid=50\">Gorge Trail #400</a>&nbsp;from the small Gorton Creek Trailhead to the southwest&nbsp;of the campground.
