This high alpine campground sits at an elevation of 9,160 feet in the Lemhi Mountain Range, 22 miles from Leadore, Idaho.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>Meadow Lake Campground is located at the base of the 10,720-foot Meadow Lake Peak and along the banks of the 13.3-acre Meadow Lake. The high elevation campground is dotted with lodge pole pine and white bark pine trees and is frequented by deer and mountain goats.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: There&#39;s no lack of recreational opportunities around Meadow Lake Campground. The lake is stocked twice a year so the fish are always biting. Fish from the bank or carry your boat down to the lake and try from the water.<br />Hiking opportunities are available right out of the campground and include trail # 342 which provides a gentle loop around the backside of the campground. Try trail # 057 which takes you up to the steep ridge above the campground (the trail to Meadow Lake Peak is not maintained by the Forest Service).&nbsp;<br />If a slower pace is appealing, pull up a chair and soak-up the incredible views from the campground.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Meadow Lake Campground consists of 17 campsites and a day use area with picnic tables, fire rings and barbecue pedestals. The campground offers two vault toilets, drinking water and day use parking.

Early settlers reportedly used this arch to move their wagons and livestock across the streambed during wet weather. Water and wind also shaped other interesting rock formations along the bluff line across the cove, including the cave (or &quot;rooms&quot; as they are often called) or overhangs.&nbsp; Native Americans used these rock overhangs for shelter while on extended hunting trips. At one time, free-roaming goats inhabited the caves, giving the formations the local name, &quot;goat houses.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm8_042749.pdf\">Alum Cove Natural Bridge Geological Area Guide</a></p>",

In addition to the original 13.75 mile section, the trail now extends from Barkshed Campground, upstream along the creek to a new trailhead on Cripple Turkey Road where it intersects the Ozark Highlands Trail. The ten mile extension was completed in 2006, largely through the efforts of the Ozark Society and American Hiking Society in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service. Three trailheads are located within the District&rsquo;s developed recreation areas: Blanchard Springs, Gunner Pool, and Barkshed. Camping is available only within developed sites at the recreation areas, but primitive camping is allowed at the Allison and Cripple Turkey Trailheads. With caution, the access roads for the extension can be negotiated in almost any vehicle. The roads are gravel, narrow, rough, and not populated or heavily traveled.

Although there are some steep sections, the trails are easy to hike with abundant resting places. The trail is located at the top of the Illinois Bayou River Drainage. It offers great views and a history lesson in Arkansas geology. While hiking the trail, you will see layer upon layer of sediment that was deposited when the area was under water millions of years ago. After the water receded, the land raised to form a dome called the Ozark Plateau. Since then, natural erosion has been occurring to form the Ozark Mountains. On the trail, you will see unique formations, called pedestals that were formed by weathering. These are the featured destination of this area. Kings Bluff features a large flat bluff top with a waterfall that flows over the ledge.

The most unique feature of East Fork Wilderness is the presence of 3 upland ponds. These areas have exposed standing water during wet weather months and support plant communities normally encountered only in bottomlands. Some of the most beautiful scenery can be found by following the hollows upward from the creek. Waterfalls from a few feet to 20 feet high are common in these hollows. In some places the creeks are bordered by high, sheer sandstone bluffs. White oak, red oak and hickory are the principal hardwoods. Hiking is a popular recreational activity in this wilderness, as well as horseback riding.</p>",

It lies approx 15 miles south of Mountain Home and 20 miles northwest of Mountain View, AR. It is bordered on the north, east, south, and southwest by 4 high ridgetop roads. The western boundary is shared with the Lower Buffalo Wilderness, which is administered by the National Park Service and is part of the Buffalo National River. There are 6 creeks within the Leatherwood Wilderness, which are separated by some of the most rugged, high ridgetop terrain in the Ozarks. They are characterized by steep-sided ridges over 1,200 ft high. Many are with long exposed sides of sheer vertical rock face and benches, giving the appearance of large stairsteps dropping into the drainage below. Elevation varies from 1,300 ft above sea level on the highest ridgetops to 420 ft where Leatherwood Creek exits the Wilderness. The forest is spotted with stands of native shortleaf pine as well as the unique cedar glades nestled within the primarily oak, gum, and hickory forest. There are no developed trails, but several old roads offer access into the wilderness. Points of Interest - Buffalo National River: was the country&#39;s first national river. Lower Buffalo Wilderness: expect to see&nbsp;bluffs, waterfalls, and old cabin sites.

White Rock Mountain is 2,260 feet above sea level and received its name from the appearance of the lichen on the sheer bluffs that look white from a distance. High bluffs surround this area. Please use caution while along the bluff line, especially with small children. White Rock Mountain is the hub of several trail systems. It offers a 13.4-mile loop trail south to Shores Lake and returns to intersect with the Ozark Highlands Trail. Around the rim of the mountaintop is a 1.5-mile loop trail. 3 rental cabins and a lodge. All three feature stone fireplaces and original furniture. The lodge can accommodate up to 30 people a night and is accessible to the physically challenged. The cabins can be rented year-round. 8 family camping units with tent pads and fire pits and one group site that will accommodate up to 10 guests. 8 family picnicking units.<br />Check out White Rock Mountain at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whiterockmountain.com/\">http://www.whiterockmountain.com/</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm8_042829.pdf\">White Rock Mountain Recreation Area Guide</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd600030.pdf\">White Rock Mountain Recreation Area Guide - Spanish</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/osfnf/recreation/?cid=fseprd637175\">Campground and Day-Use Area Rules</a></p>",

One of three wildernesses on the Buffalo Ranger District, it takes its name from the main creek running through the area with the rich, fertile soil along the lower creek portion near the Buffalo River. An unusual feature of the Ozark Mountains is that the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; are actually plateaus, uplifted as a unit with few folds or faults. The ruggedness of these mountains is due to erosion of the plateaus caused by swift rivers flowing between them. Topography within 1/4 mile on either side of Richland and Long Devil&rsquo;s Fork Creeks is quite rugged and scenic. Rock bluffs over 100 feet high and extending over a mile along each side of Richland Creek graphically reveal the earth&rsquo;s development. The forest cover is mostly second and third growth oak-hickory. Some scattered stands of shortleaf pine in old fields exist from when the Forest Service purchased the land in the 1930s and 1940s. There are no developed trails located in the wilderness. There is a system of old logging roads that run throughout the area and receive sporadic use. Kayakers float Richland Creek after rains have raised the creek water level. The wilderness area is known for its crystal clear creeks and waterfalls. Remember to take drinking water or a filtration device with you for your safety.</p>",

To restore the remainder of Midewin to tallgrass prairie and other native habitats (nearly 20,000 acres) will take considerable time and plant materials, including seed.</p><p>Three seedbeds, at the Supervisor&rsquo;s Office, River Road and Chicago Road, provide the native plant seeds from over 100 species of prairie plants to help restore Midewin with native plants.</p><p>Plantings for this seedbed began in 1996, the year Midewin was created. It is the second largest native plant seedbed at 2 acres. The plantings are mostly native grasses and forbs surrounded by a fence to prevent deer browsing. It will take a walk or bicycle ride to visit these seedbeds, located one mile south of the Hoff Road Trailhead. There is a nice walking trail around Turtle Pond here, too.</p><p>Although some types of wild seed are available from specialized native plant nurseries, many are not. That&rsquo;s one major purpose of Midewin&rsquo;s three native seed production gardens -- to produce seeds of native grasses and wildflowers that we cannot get from other sources. Many of these plant species are not commercially available, or if available, not in the amounts we need to restore prairie to Midewin. Even with our own production of seed and plants, it will still take many decades to restore much of the native habitats to Midewin.</p><p>For more information on seed production and some <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/midewin/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=STELPRDB5176370\">Frequently Asked Questions </a> visit the Land And Resources Management section of the website.</p>",

Its circumference is 18 feet 4 inches; its crown spread is 62 feet wide; and its height is 63 feet. The trail length and gentle nature of the route leading to the Big Tree make it a pleasing choice. The route follows primitive roads that pass through the rolling foothills of the Pinos Altos Mountains. Key vista points along the trail provide impressive views of the Twin Sisters and the Kneeling Nun.</p><p>During the 1960\u2019s, Fort Bayard was an active military post housing soldiers (including Buffalo Soldiers) who provided protection to the local mining settlements of Pinos Altos and Santa Rita. The route to the Big Juniper Tree is an old wagon road that provided access to the Pinos Altos Mountains. Rough cut lumber and fuel wood were transported down to the fort\u00a0via these roads and hauled on horse and mule powered wagons.</p><p>Current management of the Fort Bayard area emphasize wildlife, watershed protection and recreational activities.

The lookout was built in 1931 with materials packed in on horseback and served as a fire detection site for over 50 years.</p><p>Due to the lack of vegetation on Bald Butte, there isn&rsquo;t any shade, but the high elevation and mountain breezes stabilize the temperature. The windows open in the lookout, keeping the inside cool and the air circulating. The cozy 14&rsquo; x 14&rsquo; space sleeps two people comfortably. Besides the double bed and mattress, guests will find a table, bench, and storage cabinets. Other amenities include a propane stove and heater, refrigerator, sink, lights, and a few dishes. A vault toilet, picnic table, and fire ring complete the outside features. There is no water on site, so guests must bring sufficient supplies for drinking, cooking and washing.</p><p>At night the lookout provides an unforgettable setting for stargazing, thanks to its exposed summit. Bald Butte Lookout offers restful views, convenience to hiking trails and tranquility and seclusion that&rsquo;s reachable by car (you can drive right up to the lookout.)</p><ul><li><strong>Availability:</strong> Bald Butte Lookout is available for rent June 15 through October 15, depending on snow levels.</li><li><strong>Price and Capacit</strong>y: $40 per night, per group, with a maximum of two occupants Fees are used directly ",

It is managed to preserve a natural condition and provide opportunities for solitude.</p><p>Since its designation as a wilderness, visitor use in the area increased to a point that significant damage was occurring. Special restrictions are in place to protect the wilderness character. Visitors to this special place are asked to follow these restrictions to&nbsp;lessen your impact and&nbsp;share responsibility in preserving this unique natural resource.</p><ul></ul>",

It was saved from being cut by a timber company due to a community effort and the US Forest Service purchasing the land back from the company. Later in 1944 the tract was designated a Research Natural Area by the Forest Service. Along with a 165-acre buffer, the area is managed to protect its unique qualities. There is a 1.3 mile trail between SR 37 and a rock wall commemorating the Pioneer Mothers Forest at the bottom of the hill where a day use picnic area once stood.

In 1831, Mathew Thomas became one of the first Black land owners in the Lick Creek area. By that time, 96 African Americans lived in the region. Although Thomas was born free, in 1821 his mother indentured him to Zachariah Lindley, a founding settler of the Lick Creek community from North Carolina. Upon completion of his service, Thomas purchased eight acres. Two years later he paid the state&rsquo;s bond of $1,000 to secure his freedom.</p><p>Other local African Americans followed in Thomas&rsquo;s footsteps. In 1832, recent free Black migrants from North Carolina - Benjamin Roberts, David Dugged, and Peter Lindley - purchased forty acres each of land from the United States government. These homesteads became the center of the Lick Creek settlement.</p><p>By 1840, 10 African Americans owned land totaling 780 acres in the Lick Creek community. The settlement reached its maximum size in 1855 of over 1,500 acres.</p><p>The increasing hostility, racial intolerance, and limiting laws imposed by the state supported the need for African Americans to form strong family and communal networks within the settlement.

After his introduction to Christianity by an Englishwoman, Mary Wilder, Quinn&rsquo;s family ostracized him. Seeking refuge in England, Quinn espoused an Anglicized name and later moved to New York in 1806.</p><p>Upon arrival in New York, he became a member of the Hicksites, an anti-slavery activist Quaker group. However, in 1808, when Quinn reached Maryland he converted to Methodist. The African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) ordained Quinn as a Deacon in 1818 and in 1838 he became an elder of the church.</p><p>Starting in 1836, Quinn built churches along the Ohio River southwest of the Lick Creek community in today&rsquo;s Hoosier National Forest. Quinn&rsquo;s chapels not only brought in several hundred new people into the AME denomination, they also served as a vast network to connect small churches to the larger community. Since there were churches on both sides of the Ohio River &ndash; the boundary between a free and slave state &ndash; those such as in the Lick Creek Community served as a vital component in the Underground Railroad for the region.</p><p>William Paul Quinn&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s work centered on spreading the word of his faith and leading anti-slavery activism. In 1844, the church elected him a Bishop after he established several churches in Indiana, Missouri, and Kentucky to oppose the institution of slavery. At the 1849 AME conference, Quinn was named the Senior Bishop. He held this position until his death on February 3, 1873 in his home in Richmond, Indiana where he lived with his wife, Mary Jane.</p><p>In William Paul Quinn&rsquo;s honor, the AME founded an African American college in Austin, Texas in 1872 &ndash; the oldest in the state &ndash; to provide an education to newly free African American men and women. The school, Paul Quinn College, moved to Waco, Texas in 1881 and again in 1990 to Dallas.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>African Methodist Episcopal Church 7th Distr",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>The African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) grew out of the Free African Society that was founded in 1787. Discouraged and upset by blatant racial discrimination against free African Americans within the American Methodist church, members created an African Congregation. Although some wanted to affiliate with Protestant Episcopal, Richard Allen &ndash; a founder of the Free African Society &ndash; led a small group who were committed to remaining Methodists.</p><p>In order to assert religious autonomy, Allen sued for the rights of his congregation in 1807 and 1815 to prevent White members from interfering with his congregation.</p><p>Prior to the Civil War, AME was located mainly in the Northeast and Midwest, although churches did appear in some slave states. For instance, Bishop William Paul Quinn helped establish churches along the Ohio River in both free and slave states.</p><p>The AME churches, especially the Bethel Congregation in Pennsylvania, were known for aiding fugitive slaves on their journey to freedom as part of the Underground Railroad. Although there is no clear record, it seems likely that Quinn&rsquo;s anti-slavery work and the AME churches he helped establish along the Ohio River played a role in those quests for freedom. AME churches in Indiana near today&rsquo;s Hoosier National Forest most likely participated by providing shelter and aid to fugitives; community members also may have served as Underground Railroad &ldquo;conductors.&rdquo;</p><p>The AME church served as the focal point of the Lick Creek settlement. In 1843, early Lick Creek pioneers Thomas and Matilda Roberts sold an acre of their land to five trustees to establish the church. The trustees were Elias Roberts, Mathew Thomas, Thomas Roberts, Isaac Scott, and Samuel Chandler. The deed stated that the trustees needed to build a place for worship for members of the AME. Lick Creek&rsquo;s AME church operated until 1869.</p><p>The AME church was built near the settlement&rsquo;s Black Methodist Union Meeting House on land owned ",

Reopened in 2015, this solid and comfortable cabin accommodates 3-4 people in a remote and tranquil setting. The cabin can be rented throughout the year, but be aware that its 7,135 foot elevation means that snow can inhibit access to the cabin.</p><p>The Fremont Point cabin was rebuilt after the 2002 Winter Rim fire destroyed the 1931 original. Before it became a rental, it was used as a sleeping cabin for about 50 years by people who manned the fire lookout. The new cabin was constructed to preserve its historic roots.</p><p>The 24 x 16 feet cabin features a bunk bed and a double bed, both with mattresses, a&nbsp;dining table with four chairs, a fireplace and small kitchen area. Kitchen amenities include a mid-sized refrigerator, sink (but no running water), propane cooktop with four burners, counter space, and shelving. Outside you&rsquo;ll find a picnic table, fire ring, and new vault toilet. A wrap-around porch and wood storage box complete the exterior. Situated about 1/4 mile beyond the day use area, there is a privacy gate where visitors enter their reservation code to gain access.</p><p>Wildlife viewing is abundant near the Fremont Point cabin. Recreation opportunities include hunting along Winter Rim to the west, and hiking, mountain biking, or horseback riding along the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/fremont-winema/recarea/?recid=70808\">Fremont National Recreation Trail</a>. The trail is just 200 yards from the cabin. In the winter, cross country skiing and snowmobiling are popular pursuits. The cabin sits about 13 miles from the Pole Butte Sub Station, with a warming hut situated mid-way.</p><ul><li><strong>Avail",

This special designation provides certain challenges in a flammable habitat such as the sand pine scrub for which our forest is famous, since firefighting options are limited. As a result, portions of the wilderness may seem denuded after a forest fire. But the scrub regenerates quickly, pushing up saw palmetto and young sand pines to provide shade and habitat for wildlife. The wilderness contains a mosaic of habitats bound together by the flow of open prairies, many with ponds, across the landscape. By hiking, backpacking, or paddling through the wilderness, you can enjoy the flora and fauna of pine flatwoods, hardwood swamps, shallow lakes, grassy prairies, sand pine scrub, oak scrub, sinkholes, and sawgrass marsh.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r4-u13cAuxk?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>",

Used as a drinking water source since pre-settlement times, dams were constructed on the springs by early loggers before the turn of the century. The dams were useful in diverting water to the logging camps nearby. Most of Cooke Pond was dry land then.</p><p>Europeans have visited the springs for recreation since the 1920s. A trail to the springs was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps&nbsp;in 1934. Early photographs show the dam being repaired and reinforced by the CCC&#39;s. The dams lasted until 1981 when a storm took them out. The site was renovated in 1991.
