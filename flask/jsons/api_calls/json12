Adams can change rapidly. Sudden snowstorms can occur above 6,000 feet elevation at any month of the year. What appears to be a non-technical route can change drastically during these storms. Your safety requires preparation and good judgment.

Detailed information on climbing routes is available from a number of climbing guidebooks. Consult these as you plan your trips.&nbsp;In addition to the <a href=\"https://www.mountaineers.org/blog/what-are-the-ten-essentials\">Ten Essentials</a> for outdoor recreation, equipment should include sturdy hiking boots, ice ax, crampons, and ropes when travelling on glaciers.

The &quot;new&quot; cabin was built to replace a deteriorated log cabin erected by homesteader John Peters in 1890, and abandoned after his first winter at the site. The Forest Service used the old Peters cabin as one of their first ranger stations in the area. Peters built his cabin along the old &quot;McClellan Trail&quot; used by Captain George B. McClellan during his 1853 railroad survey. Traces of the old McClellan trail are still visible near the Peterson Prairie Guard Station.</p><p>In his diary for October 1926, Ranger Harvey Welty listed the equipment stored at Peterson Prairie Guard Station at the end of the season: &quot;2 riding saddles, 2 riding bridles, chaps, 6 halters, blankets for saddles, 1 sledge (#8), 1 double-bitted axe, 1 gas lantern, 1 kerosene lantern, 1 lamp stand, 1 gas lantern pump, 1 gas lantern wrench, 1 heating stove, 1 Colonial Jr. stove, 1 6 1/2 ft. falling saw, 2 saw handles, 1 grind stone.&quot; It was nearing the end of the era of the horseback rangers.</p>",

In 1932 the Forest Service built a standard L-4 style lookout on a 30 foot pole frame tower to replace the earlier structure. Some reconstruction occurred in 1955. The present lookout is a 15 x 15 foot R-6 Flat Top Style built in 1973. The lookout still serves as a summer home for a Forest Service fire lookout person, who plays a key role in the detection of fires on the Barlow Ranger District and adjoining lands.&nbsp; The lookout is surrounded by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mthood/recarea/?recid=79434\">Badger Creek Wilderness</a></p>",

It crosses the creek once, about 1/2 mile from the trailhead. At approximately 2 miles up the trail, the junction with the old trail to Marble Pass to the south is still visible. From that point the trail traverses an open hillside meadow resplendent with wildflowers in the summer. Mountain goats are often seen in their haunts on the ridge west of the Twin Lakes basin. A large flat meadow just above the eastern shore of the lakes provides an ample camping area and grazing for horse; other camping areas exist between the two lakes.</p>",

It is easy to locate and is accessible practically year-round. There are over 15 miles of looping Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) trails that travel across over 3,000 acres of public land jointly managed by the Forest Service (FS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Wyoming State Trust. There is plenty of OHV fun for the whole family as the trails offer varying degrees of difficulty from beginner to more experienced and include two trail bridges and hill climbs. The majority of the trails are only open to OHV&rsquo;s less than 60 inches on BLM and 50 inches on FS. Development of this area has been gradually improving with more planned in the near future. There are several parking areas located along the main road with the largest just off the highway. A vault toilet is located one mile in and is across from Weston Reservoir Pond where large trout are just waiting to be caught. The area also caters to other outdoor pursuits with the many dispersed campsites located on the FS along FSR 1246 with the best sites located at the top of the buttes on BLM land. There are plans to re-surface the main road and parking area in 2020/2021. Visitors should currently be prepared for a muddy road during wet periods.</span></p>",

Upstream, the canyon becomes very narrow and steep. Most of the year the river has to be crossed to reach its upper portions.

In July of 1996, 7,000 acres were burned as the result of a lightning strike. Watch the area regrow as the years go by.&nbsp; It is managed by the Douglas Ranger District.</p>",

The Halfway Flat Campground is nestled in an old-growth forest of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and a cedar under story with grassy areas, ferns and mosses. With the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas nearby, the location is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, elk, porcupine, native fish and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the Northern Spotted Owl, gray wolves, and grizzly bears also find havens in local ecosystems.<br /><br />Summer temperatures are generally sunny and warm with little precipitation, and winters boast mostly clear skies, but plenty of snow.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: The campground setting provides ready access to Naches River, where fishing is popular. Hiking and horseback riding trails extend into the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas, and off-road vehicle and snowmobile access draws visitors to the Little Naches drainage.&nbsp;<br /><br />In winter, snowmobiling is popular in the Little Naches Drainage. Halfway Flat Campground is conveniently located 30 minutes below the summit of Chinook Pass and Mt. Rainer National Park. A trip along the scenic Mather Parkway is a fantastic outing. The Naches River, adjacent to the campground offers a scenic backdrop for anglers. Its cold, clear waters sustain populations of rainbow and brown trout. Whitewater enthusiasts may enjoy a paddle on the river or one of the many other tributaries draining the Cascade region.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: The campground has five campsites available for advanced reservation between Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend. After, mid-September sites will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Vault toil",

Mount Hood attracts more than 10,000 climbers a year, making Mount Hood&#39;s summit the most visited snow covered peak in America.</p><p>Consider climbing mid-week to enhance your opportunity for solitude. Check out this video overview for some key information about what it takes to climb safely:</p><p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z__15ZUtsG8\" width=\"220\"></iframe></p><p><strong>Safety Concerns</strong></p><p>You are responsible for your safety. Those planning to climb should take all necessary equipment for self-rescue and extended stays on the mountain due to weather or incident. <strong>There are no emergency medical services available on the mountain</strong>. It is a remote location.&nbsp; Any help may be hours or days out,&nbsp;especially in situations where&nbsp;your location or weather would create an unsafe situation for rescuers. It is always advisable to leave your itinerary and estimated time of return with a third party. &nbsp;The southside climbing route leaves from the historic <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mthood/recreation/recarea/?recid=53626\">Timberline Lodge</a>.

The American Forks Campground is nestled in an old-growth forest of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and a cedar under story with grassy areas, ferns, and mosses. With the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas nearby, the location is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, elk, porcupine, native fish, and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the northern spotted owl, gray wolves, and grizzly bears also find havens in local ecosystems. Summer temperatures are generally sunny and warm with little precipitation, and winters boast mostly clear skies, but plenty of snow.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>The campground setting provides ready access to Bumping Lake, where boating and fishing are popular. Hiking and horseback riding trails extend into the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas, and off-road vehicle and snowmobile access draws visitors to the Little Naches drainage. In winter, snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing are popular in the American River area. The cabin is also conveniently located 30 minutes below the summit of Chinook Pass and Mt. Rainer National Park. A trip along the scenic Mather Parkway is a fantastic outing. The American River, adjacent to the campground, offers a scenic backdrop for anglers. Its cold, clear waters sustain populations of rainbow and brown trout. Whitewater enthusiasts may enjoy a paddle on the river or one of the many other tributaries draining into the Cascade region.</p><p><strong>Facilities: </strong>The campground has 8 reservable sites and 4 first-come, first-served sites between Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend.
