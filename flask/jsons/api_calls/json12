The &quot;new&quot; cabin was built to replace a deteriorated log cabin erected by homesteader John Peters in 1890, and abandoned after his first winter at the site. The Forest Service used the old Peters cabin as one of their first ranger stations in the area. Peters built his cabin along the old &quot;McClellan Trail&quot; used by Captain George B. McClellan during his 1853 railroad survey. Traces of the old McClellan trail are still visible near the Peterson Prairie Guard Station.</p><p>In his diary for October 1926, Ranger Harvey Welty listed the equipment stored at Peterson Prairie Guard Station at the end of the season: &quot;2 riding saddles, 2 riding bridles, chaps, 6 halters, blankets for saddles, 1 sledge (#8), 1 double-bitted axe, 1 gas lantern, 1 kerosene lantern, 1 lamp stand, 1 gas lantern pump, 1 gas lantern wrench, 1 heating stove, 1 Colonial Jr. stove, 1 6 1/2 ft. falling saw, 2 saw handles, 1 grind stone.&quot; It was nearing the end of the era of the horseback rangers.</p>",

During that same&nbsp;time the country was&nbsp;experiencing a&nbsp;booming gold rush.&nbsp; Dick Owen worked at Hassel in the mines and possibly at the Park mines. By the early 1900&#39;s, the Owen&#39;s had moved to Radersburg, where Sarah Owen ran a boarding house.&nbsp; In 1905, the Elkhorn Forest Reserve was formed.&nbsp; In 1908, the Helena National Forest was designated and Eagle Cabin became an administrative site. The Eagle, Tizer and Glendale Stations were all&nbsp;linked by a telephone line and connected to&nbsp;the switchboard at a Radersburg store. The cabin is the oldest administrative log structure on the Helena National Forest and predates the establishment of the Forest.&nbsp; Eagle Station was used by the Forest Service on a regular basis until the early 1950&#39;s. Riders from the Crow and Indian Creek Livestock Association used the cabin over the years until the 1970&#39;s.&nbsp; Due to the historical value of Eagle Cabin,&nbsp;it&nbsp;has been determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. From 1991-1994, the Forest Service, with the help of volunteers and donated materials, restored the cabin. Primitive building skills and materials were used to restore the cabin&#39;s original features. The current site consists of the cabin, a woodshed, toilet, barn, horse corrals, a fire ring, and is surrounded by a jackleg pole fence. There is no potable water or electricity at the site. &nbsp;The cabin is heated with a wood stove; a propane camp stove is also provided for cooking. There are three bunk beds that accommodate six people. Also&nbsp;provided&nbsp;are: dishes, silverware",

In 1932 the Forest Service built a standard L-4 style lookout on a 30 foot pole frame tower to replace the earlier structure. Some reconstruction occurred in 1955. The present lookout is a 15 x 15 foot R-6 Flat Top Style built in 1973. The lookout still serves as a summer home for a Forest Service fire lookout person, who plays a key role in the detection of fires on the Barlow Ranger District and adjoining lands.&nbsp; The lookout is surrounded by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mthood/recarea/?recid=79434\">Badger Creek Wilderness</a></p>",

When the surviving son passed away in 2003 the cabin was donated to the Forest Service by the Kenck Family Trust. In accepting the cabin the Forest committed to listing it on the National Register of Historic Places and making it available to the public. The cabin is open all year except for general rifle season (Oct 15 to Dec 1)</p><p>The cabin is one room and sleeps 6 with one double bed, one futon that makes into a bouble bed and two cots. Heating and cooking is from 2 wood stoves. Firewood is provided. Water must be hauled from the nearby stream. Renters should bring their own drinking water or be prepared to filter or boil stream water. There is no electricity or sewer at the cabin. The cabin is not accessible to the disabled. Bring your own bedding, flashlight, food, small propane cylinders (for the lanterns) and cooler. Cooking utensils and dishes are provided.</p><p>No livestock or pets are permitted.</p><p><strong>This is grizzly/black bear country&nbsp;so bears may frequent the area; keep all food out of sight in approved containers and remove all food from area after eating.

The ability to experience wild water, world-class fishing, great hiking, and memorable camping are just a few&nbsp;of the reasons we all visit the Snake River Canyon. The privilege of use carries the responsibility to help care for this unique watershed. Your actions leave an impression on the river and on other people. The most important thing you can bring to the river is an attitude of cooperation and consideration for wildlife and other river users. Adherence to rules and ethics regarding responsible use and a friendly demeanor towards others will leave a positive impression that will prevent the need for more restrictions. Together we can work together to protect this remarkable recreation resource we call the Snake River.</p><p>Each summer from the June to August, the portion of the Snake River between South Park Bridge and Sheep Gulch hosts over 200,000 visitors. This is an extremely crowded and sought after section of the Snake River due to the great variety in boating challenges, fishing opportunities and beautiful scenery. In an effort to alleviate some of the crowding, the Jackson Ranger District river program requires <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/btnf/?cid=STELPRDB5287951\">special use permits</a> for non-commercial groups over 15 people and for institutional outfitters.</p><p>If you are a single kayaker, or a small group we encourage you to help us further reduce congestion by launching at East Table or Elbow boat ramps rather than at West Table boat ramp. East Table boat ramp is specifically a &ldquo;no-trailer&rdquo; site to help reduce congestion and the no trailer rule is strictly enforced for this purpose.</p><p>Check the water levels before you go.&nbsp; The river can be very different depending on how high or low the water is, creating new challenges e",

Mostly composed of granite uplifts from deep within the earth over 1 billion years ago, these granite monoliths were uplifted and carved by glaciers 500,000 years ago to form circular valley cirques. The Wind River Range is not only one of the oldest mountain ranges in North America, but has the most extensive glacial network in the lower 48 states. Elevations range from 8,000 feet at Green River Lakes to 13,804 feet at Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in the middle Rocky Mountains.</p><p>The Green River Lakes are considered the headwaters of the Green River; the chief tributary to the Colorado River. The Green River runs 730 miles through Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and eventually terminates in northern Mexico.They are also the starting point for many backpacking trails including the northern entrance to the frequently used Highline Trail, which extends along most of the Wind River Range and follows the spine of the Continental Divide south to Big Sandy Opening.</p><p>Hiking the Highline Trail:</p><p>Visitors have a view of the much-photographed large-granite monolith, Squaretop Mountain (11,695 feet) from the Green River Lakes. The mountain looms over pristine blue-green lakes. You can expect to view glimpses of large game animals such as moose, elk, deer, and prong",

Several large informational panels provide historical accounts and pictures of the landslide, which are the only facilities located on site.

No cellular service available.</p><p>On June 23, 1925, hurling down the slope at 50 mph, the mile-wide Gros Ventre Slide carried 50,000,000 cubic yards of debris down the mountain and then another 300 feet up the opposite slope. The Slide blocked the Gros Ventre River, and formed a five-mile long body of water known today as Lower Slide Lake.</p><p>Today the Gros Ventre Slide is a large geologic scar marking the north side of Sheep Mountain and can be seen from miles around. At the site of the Gros Ventre Slide there is an interpretive trail that winds through the jumble of debris and new growth that resulted from the Slide. Interpretive signs at the turnout describe this historic geological event, providing insight into how such a powerful land movement occurred. Geologically speaking, the mountains in this area are relatively young and still quite active. Earthquakes can be felt year-round as evidenced by many smaller slumps present throughout the Gros Ventre Corridor, but none yet as dramatic as the Gros Ventre Slide.</p><p>Learn more about the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5340454.pdf\">history behind the Gros Ventre Slide Geological Site</a>.&nbsp;</p>",
