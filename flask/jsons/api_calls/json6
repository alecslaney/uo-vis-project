One local legend is that Hannagan was chained to a tree by the meadow until his debt of $1,200 was paid off. Fortunately it was promptly paid by his son, but the name stuck.&nbsp;Another story suggests that Toles Cosper, a rancher from nearby&nbsp;Luna,&nbsp;New Mexico was riding with the young Hannagan when they came across the meadow during the 1870s. They flipped a coin to see which man they would name it after, and Hannagan won.</p><p>Toles Cosper&#39;s son, DeWitt Cosper, built a lodge here in 1926.&nbsp;Hannagan Meadow is currently the highest point in Arizona to be inhabited throughout the entire year. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Winter Trails Highlights</strong></p><p>The groomed ski trails at Hannagan Meadow are narrower and generally more challenging than those at Williams Valley.

Baden-Powell.&nbsp;</p><p>The trail is the most difficult route to the summit but is the most popular way to reach the top. This 8-mile trek features 35 switchbacks up the north face of one of the tallest mountains in the San Gabriels. Those attempting this &quot;must-do&quot; hike will find the beginning part of the hike the most difficult with the rest being slightly easier. The trail will take backpackers under the spine of the ridge through stands of Jeffrey, Ponderosa, and Lodgepole pines. What&#39;s more, be sure to stop and admire the 1,500-year-old Limber pine at the timberline.&nbsp;</p><p>Fun fact: Mt. Baden-Powell is named after Lord Robert Baden-Powell in 1931.

This started an ongoing quest to discover what caused the death of so many bison. Archeologists continue to research the exact nature of past events and the role that ancient Paleo-Indian people may have played in them. While theories are plentiful, there is still no clear answer to the mystery. The Hudson-Meng Education and Research Center&rsquo;s Bison Bonebed Tour encourages visitors to develop their own ideas based on the evidence presented.</p><p>The Bison Trail connects the Hudson-Meng visitor center to Toadstool Geologic Park.

The mines are hazardous, so do not enter them. The chimney in the wood picnic shelter is all that remains of a farmhouse the once occupied this site. The exceptional craftsmanship of civilian works programs are evident in the wood shelter that was built by Job Corps in the late 1960s. The foundation and chimney stone from the old farm house were used to form the original picnic shelter. The farmhouse was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. In exchange for the building of the house the owners agreed to sell what is now Alpine Picnic Area to the federal government. The house was eventually torn down in the early 1960s.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/dbnf/?cid=fseprd606571\"><img alt=\"Send Your Photos\" src=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/fseprd611543.jpg\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 106px;\" /></a></p><p>Make this page look nicer by <a href=\"mailto:gwen.hensley@usda.gov?subject=Alpine%20Picnic%20Area%20photos&amp;body=I've%20attached%20my%20photos%20of%20Alpine%20Picnic%20Area",

This is a perfect place to &ldquo;get away from it all&rdquo; and to stay before rafting the Wild North Fork. The campground is also popular with four-wheel-drive groups who enjoy driving the jeep trails and back roads of the area.</p><p>The landscape surrounding the campground is dramatically steep and rocky. The vegetation is sparse due to the serpentine soil which stunts plant growth. The Biscuit Fire swept through the area in 2002, burning much of the vegetation in the surrounding area.</p><p>Spring and early summer bring beautiful wildflowers to the area including the fragrant western azalea and beautiful blue brodiaeas. The campground is&nbsp;within the North Fork Smith River&nbsp;botanical area, which harbors many rare plants adapted to the serpentine soil.</p><p>Access to the North Fork of the Smith River is &frac14; mile west of the campground at the North Fork river access (also known as&nbsp;Brown&#39;s Flat and Major Moore&#39;s). There are some nice pools but the water is very chilly and the shoreline is very cobbled except for&nbsp;a small patch of sand at the upstream end. It is a good place to sit on a rock and soak your feet on a hot day.</p><p>Click on the &quot;Photos and Multimedia&quot; link on the right sidebar to view a photo of the North Fork river access.</p>",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "The Lye Brook Wilderness is east of Manchester Center in the southern Green Mountains of Vermont. This wilderness is named after Lye Brook, which flows through its western half. The wilderness ranges from 900 feet to 2900 feet above sea level. Most is above 2500 feet, on a high plateau with several ponds and bogs. Waterfalls and rocky streams may be found here as well as reflecting pools. The western section is extremely steep, facing west-northwest towards U.S. Route 7 and Manchester. Four and a half miles of the Appalachian/Long Trail cross the northwest tip of the wilderness. Approximately 80% of the area is forested with northern hardwoods: birch, beech, and maple. Thickets of small spruce dot the area. Remnants of railroad grades and old logging roads remain. Several species of neotropical birds, black bear, moose, deer, pine martin and bobcat inhabit these woods. There are many marshy areas off trail and the ecological balance is quite fragile. Take care and be prepared for muddy trails and an intense black fly season in the spring and early summer. Hunting opportunities for deer bring many seasonal visitors, as do snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in the winter months. ",

The fire burned all of the supporting wood frame of the lookout cab underneath its metal exterior. The tower is no longer safe for visitors. Forest Service officials are uncertain at this time if the structure will be rebuilt.</p><p>Tater Knob Fire Tower was the last remaining fire tower on the Daniel Boone National Forest. It was built in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps as a lookout for detecting forest fires. The cab of this 35-ft. tower was home to the lookout operators who staffed it during the fire season. In a space less than 200 square feet, the cab had just enough room for a wood stove, two cots, a cabinet, storage box, small table, and a stool. The all-important alidade, or fire finder, stood in the middle of the room.</p><p>Tater Knob Fire TowerThe original wooden cab was reconstructed in 1959, reduced to nearly half its original size. The lookouts no longer lived in the tower. Instead, they climbed to the peak of Tater Knob every day of the fire season to watch for smoke. By the mid-1970s, aircraft became the new method for spotting forest fires. The fire towers, including Tater Knob, were abandoned from use.</p><p>The tower is currently listed on the National Historic Lookout Register.</p><p>Learn more about fire towers by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.firelookout.org/\">Forest Fire Lookout Association website.</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5276780.pdf\">Cave Run Lake area map</a></p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>",

Numerous leaks have been found and the water system has been compromised. To do the necessary repairs to&nbsp;the water system, the campground would have to remain closed until the required testing shows it is safe to use.&nbsp;Portable toilets and handwashing stations are available with regular servicing, but the bathhouses and spigots will remain closed/off until after hunting season when we can assess the entire system and get it back online.</strong></p><p>Wright Lake is a quiet scenic lakefront recreation area that offers a host of amenities and activities for campers and day-trippers. The area around the clear, spring-fed lake offers both a day-use area for swimming, picnicking, and hiking, and a campground in a beautiful forest setting along one portion of the lakeshore. It is perfect for fishing and boating. Swimmers can enjoy the white sand beach, and a nearby bathhouse includes flush toilets and hot showers. Picnic tables and grills are scattered among trees with views of the lake.</p><p>The campground includes 18 campsites with picnic tables, grills, tent pads and fire rings. The recreation area is fairly level and easily accessible. Hikers can enjoy a 4.6-mile interpretive trail that circles the lake.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3829573.pdf\">Check out our brochure to learn more about all there is to do around Wright Lake!</a></strong> (pdf)</p>",

Nonmotorized boats are allowed on the 15-acre lake where you might reel-in a largemouth bass, brim&nbsp;or catfish.</p><p>The landscape consists mostly of a longleaf pine and hardwood hammock forest. Bald eagles and songbirds are at home in this longleaf pine forest that also makes room for cypress, tupelo trees, turkey oak, and palmettos. Rare species of plants and animals can be found at Silver Lake, but the observant visitor is more likely to see turtles, alligators, bears, turkeys, and armadillos.</p><p>Silver Lake is in the Munson Sandhills, which are composed of deep dry sands that have accumulated over limestone. Because the sand absorbs rainfall so completely, wetlands are relatively rare in this part of the forest. In places, the limestone dissolves and collapses, forming the depressions and ponds, lakes and sinkholes that are common in the area.</p><p>Camping is not allowed at Silver Lake, but restrooms&nbsp;are available.

Located along the Apalachicola River, this interpretive area offers detailed information about the site and its history along with trails, river access, and a picnic area.</p><p>Built during the War of 1812,&nbsp;the British&nbsp;Fort was placed in a strategic spot along the Apalachicola River, which was the &quot;highway for commerce&quot; in those pre-road, pre-railroad days.</p><p>On July 27, 1816, U.S. Navy forces led by Colonel Duncan Clinch fired on what was then called &quot;The Negro Fort.&quot; One of the early shots from the ship&#39;s guns landed on a ammunition shed inside the fort, resulting in a massive explosion which left only 33 survivors to tell the tale.</p><p>In 1818, Lt. James Gadsden oversaw construction of a new fort on the site as a U.S. fort in the heart of Spanish territory, under the auspices of Major General Andrew Jackson. This fort, Fort Gadsden, remained in use until 1821, when Florida became a U.S. Territory.</p><p>Detailed interpretive information in the form of kiosks and signage lead you through the site of both forts and the cemetery where the victims from 1816 are buried.</p><p>Interested in learning more of the story? <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3828073.pdf\">Here&#39;s an interpretive brochure</a> (PDF).</p><!--<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpoFQY16a0E?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>&lt;--/p&gt; </p>-->",

The majority of the climbing is characterized by steep highly pocketed limestone/sandstone mix cliffs. Route length varies from short &ldquo;bouldery&rdquo; twenty foot routes to long &ldquo;pumpy&rdquo; routes around seventy feet. On vertical walls, the rock can be bubbly with edges and blocks. If you want to find fun and safe sport climbing on the Coconino National Forest, this is your place. Sport climbing, focused on movement and safety offers the opportunity for large dynamic moves on well protected routes. Fixed anchoring systems here keep climbers safe while minimizing impact to the rock compared to traditional anchoring systems such as pitons and trees. Jacks Canyon boasts 300 routes of what some consider being some of the best sport climbing in the country. Jacks Canyon is a great collaboration between the National Forest and the rapidly growing user group of rock climbers.</p><p>The roll-over photos here are from the top of the rim overlooking climbing areas and at the bottom at the creek.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Camping</strong>: The camping is free and unimproved at the canyon rim, where a 10 minute trail gets you to the routes. Please camp at obvious sites.</p><p><strong>Weather</strong>: The Weather is great year round with spring and fall offering the best conditions. In the summer you&rsquo;ll be chasing the shade with temperatures rising to the 90&rsquo;s F. During the winter, temperatures can get down",

Freedom seekers who escaped south found the prospect of a promised land at the fort. Around 800 escaped slaves settled around the area Apalachicola. The settlement of free Blacks and Native Americans within the Spanish Florida territory alarmed the United States and prompted U.S. troops to build Fort Scott in nearby Georgia in anticipation of dealing with the Prospect Bluff settlement.</p><p>&nbsp;On 1816, then Major General Andrew Jackson ordered the destruction of the fort. On July 27, 1816, the horrific destruction occurred. Inexperienced escaped slaves attempted, and failed, to fight back with cannons left by the British. The violent attack left about 30 Seminoles and 300 free Blacks dead. The surviving African-Americans were brought back to Georgia and returned to slavery.</p><p>After the 1816 attack, Americans built a second fort in the same location and named it Fort Gadsden during the onset of Seminole Wars &ndash; around 1817.

Common vegetation includes Engelmann spruce, aspen and fir stands with large meadows. The general terrain is a large meadow encompassed by trees. This area is open to ATV use on designated roads and trails. Please help prevent erosion and soil compaction by staying on roads and main driving trails. Driving on the meadows creates ruts or channels that water flows through, removing topsoil and creating scars tht last many lifetimes. Delicate meadow plants can be damaged, leaving less forage for wildlife and leaving the soil unprotected. when riders drive through the trees and around them in circles the soil becomes compacted, depriving root systems of water and air, this will eventually kill the tree.</p>",

Hamburg boasted a population of 5000 around 1880. Hamburg Postmaster Dan Caldwell built the old store west of the campground along the highway in 1859. Caldwell&#39;s sister-in-law, Sarah Totten, operated the store/hotel until she died and it closed in 1930. Sarah owned property where the campground is located. She donated the land to the Forest Service on the condition they use it as a recreation area. It was named in her honor. Crumpled structures and rock foundations are all that remain of the Johnston&#39;s Store, Bailey Post Office, and Bucket Of Blood Saloon. In Hamburg&#39;s prime, these establishments catered to wealthy fly fishermen and sportsmen, including Zane Grey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Further protection was given when this area became part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, created by the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964.

The majority of the Wilderness lies in two districts of the Mendocino National Forest (Covelo and Grindstone Ranger Districts). The far northern portion of the Wilderness is in the Yolla Bolly&nbsp;Ranger District of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. To the far west, a part of the Wilderness is in the Mad River Ranger District of the Six Rivers National Forest, and the Bureau of Land Management has a small portion of the Wilderness (also on the western edge).</p><p>The lowest point of the Wilderness is along Cottonwood Creek (2,600&#39; elevation). This is just four and a half miles from the highest point, Mount Linn, at an elevation of 8,092 feet. Several other peaks push their way above 7,000 feet and provide fine views (weather and smoke permitting) of Mount Lassen, Mount Shasta, the Trinity Alps, the Kings Range and sometimes the Pacific Ocean.</p>",

The area is less than a four-hour drive from San Francisco, Santa Rosa, and Sacramento.</p><p>The central feature of this wilderness is the large broad topped Snow Mountain, which drains water toward the Sacramento River on the east and the Eel River Basin on the west. The wilderness also has the largest known waterfall on the forest. Elevations range from 1,800 feet in the gorge of the Middle Fork of Stony Creek to 7,056 feet on the summit of East Snow Mountain Peak. The deep canyons skirting the Wilderness compress ecological life zones creating a unique biological sky-island.</p><p>Forty miles of trail are located in the wilderness. This leaves a vast amount of acreage very remote and highly conducive to cross-country exploration. The moderate hike to the top of East Peak affords visitors a magnificent view of the Sacramento Valley and the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east, Clear Lake to the southwest, the Coastal Mountains to the west, and the timbered mountains of the Mendocino National Forest to the North.</p><p>Good drinking water is scarce in the Snow Mountain Wilderness during much of the summer. Plan ahead and refill canteens at every opportunity. Mountain streams may look inviting but they may not be safe for drinking. Treat all water for drinking and cooking by either processing through a portable water filter or by boiling over a portable cook stove.</p>",

The Great Sanhedrin was the supreme council of the ancient Hebrews and the imposing ridge that crowns this Wilderness was named after that high council. The terrain in this area is moderately steep and rugged. The Wilderness is managed by the Forest Service, but includes areas of private land.</p><p>Elevations in the Wilderness vary from 6,175 feet at Big Signal peak to 1,600 along Thomas Creek. The major creeks in the area drain westward to the Eel River. Soils are moderately to highly erodible, and an unstable fault zone transects the Rocky Point-Ascherman Ranch area.</p><p><strong>Trails in the Sanhedrin</strong><br />Developed trails do not exist within the Sanhedrin at this time, providing a truly untrammeled Wilderness experience. The only public access point for this area is by the lookout on Big Signal Peak at the end of Forest Road 20N04. From this location, visitors can enjoy off trail hunting, hiking, and camping activities.</p><p>Although you may come across an old road or cattle trail while visiting the Sanhedrin, no managed trails existed upon designation of the Wilderness. Employees and wilderness stewardship volunteers have begun to identify potential opportunities to designate and maintain foot and horse trails in the Sanhedrin for future use and enjoyment.</p><p>We recommend that when visiting the area you bring the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic maps that cover the region:&nbsp; USGS maps for the Sanhedrin Wilderness include Sanhedrin Mountain, Brushy Mountain, Foster Mountain, and Van Arsdale Reservoir. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5181589.pdf\">PDF MAP &raquo;</a></p>",

It&rsquo;s an open landscape where wiregrass, or sometimes palmetto, covers the forest floor. Swamps and savannahs are commonly interspersed with the longleaf community. Much of the soil here is sandy and often wet. Wildflowers such as orchids, pitcher plants, and sundews flourish. These savannahs are some of the most botanically rich areas in the country. Do you know that Florida has about 3,500 species of wildflowers?</p><p>The byway begins 9 miles south of Bristol on State Road 12. From State Road 12, turn onto State Road 379 heading south to the town of Sumatra. Travel through the flat-to-gently rolling terrain. Stop and explore bays of magnolia and cypress, groves of oaks, or stands of longleaf pine that thrive in the sandhills and flatwoods. History buffs enjoy visiting <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/apalachicola/recarea/?recid=75221\">Fort Gadsden Historic Site </a>near the southern end of the byway.</p><p>The byway is ecologically important as a showcase for one of the largest remaining blocks of natural longleaf pine/wiregrass communities in existence. Longleaf forest surrounded with lush wiregrass once stretched from Virginia through Florida and west to Texas. Today, only enough longleaf forests remain to fill an area the size of Virginia, much of it right here in north Florida.</p><p>Endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers, fox squirrels, black bears, bobcats, wild turkeys, gray foxes, raccoons, and alligators are at home in the diversified ecosystems of the Apalachee Savannahs Scenic Byway. Search for sights and sounds and enjoy the beauty of the savannahs. <em>Take Only Pictures, Leave Only Footprints.</em></p>",

If you&rsquo;re brave enough, you can climb the tower and enjoy a panoramic view of the surrounding countryside.</p><p>The Jones Spring non-motorized area is nearby, and offers hiking, hunting&nbsp;and cross-country skiing. Also nearby is Cathedral Pines, an area that survived Wisconsin&rsquo;s logging era where the majestic pines and hemlocks have been preserved in their natural state.&nbsp;General use at this popular campground is heavy throughout the summer, mostly on weekends. There are plenty of sites to see on the district and Bagley Rapids Recreation area can serve as a home base.</p><p>So, if you like to swim, fish, hike, picnic then the Bagley Rapids Recreation Area is the place for you, conveniently located just 5 minutes south of Mountain.</p>",

The area has been described as a rugged land containing steep canyons with long, gentle ridges in between. It was named in honor of the Yuki Tribe, who once called this area home. Management of the area is shared between the Mendocino National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management, Arcata Field Office.</p><p>The Yuki Wilderness ranges in elevation from almost 6,500 feet near Windy Gap in the southeast to roughly 1,150 feet along the Middle Fork Eel River. When visiting the Yuki you will experience a wide variety of vegetation, including grasslands, chaparral thickets, oak groves and forests of Shasta red fir, white fir, Jeffrey pine, sugar pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and incense cedar. Six of California&#39;s fifteen species of oaks are found within the Yuki Wilderness.</p><p>If you visit during the spring months the Yuki will delight you with its spectacular wildflower displays! The Middle Fork Eel Wild and Scenic River flows through the northwestern portion of the Yuki Wilderness, and is home to rainbow trout, and threatened runs of steelhead and Chinook salmon. It is estimated that the river supports over one-third of California&#39;s remaining summer-run steelhead trout population. In addition, many interesting animals call the area home, including bald eagle, pine marten, goshawk, northern spotted owl, prairie falcon, river otter, beaver, tule elk, mountain lion, black bear, porcupine, ringtail, gray fox, badger, golden eagle, blue grouse and pileated woodpecker. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/STELPRDB5180361.pdf\">PDF MAP &raquo;</a></p>",

From mid-June until Labor Day, over 20,000 people visit the Cave and take the guided tours. The cave stays a brisk 40 degrees all year so bring your jacket! Minnetonka is one of two caverns administered by the Forest Service. Within St. Charles Canyon are campgrounds and a large group use areas with fishing and hiking nearby. Keep an eye out of resident wildlife such as moose and deer.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Attention! If you plan on visiting Minnetonka Cave please DO NOT wear any clothing (including shoes, hats, belts, jewelry) or bring any items with you (such as cameras, backpacks, cell phones, purses, etc) that have been in another cave or mine. This precaution is in place to protect the native bats from White Nose Syndrome. We appreciate your cooperation and hope you enjoy your tour.</em></strong></p><p>Due to the westward spread of White Nose syndrome (WNS), restrictions on clothing and items that have been in other caves are currently in place at Minnetonka Cave to prevent introduction of this bat disease into Idaho. It is possible for humans to spread the disease between caves if clothing or equipment has been exposed to the fungus. Leaving clothing or other items that have been in another cave at home will help protect bat species inhabiting Minnetonka Cave. Introduction of this disease into Minnetonka Cave would devastate local bat populations, and in the event of a cave closure, greatly impact local economies.

With its spectacular setting, the Inn was a popular spot for social gatherings in its past lives. It had its day as a hotel, a cafe, and a dance hall. Later it became a way station on the Yellowstone Highway for ranchers, sportsmen, and tourists. After acquiring the inn from Montana Power in 1986, the Forest Service partnered with Harriman State Park and other generous groups to renovate the facilities and keep the site open. Big Falls Inn is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Exhibits on the natural and cultural history of the area can be enjoyed inside the visitor center.</p><p>From the Visitor Center, an accessible trail and boardwalk provide spectacular views of <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/ctnf/?cid=STELPRDB5196020\">Mesa Falls</a>. &nbsp;A rainbow often decorates the canyon on summer mornings when sunlight passes through the mist, and interpretive panels share the natural and cultural history of the area.

Because the cabins are located at an elevation of 4,800 feet, visitors need to be prepared for a variety of weather including warm afternoons, chilly nights and afternoon thunderstorms. It is also not unusual to experience a dusting of snow during the early spring and later fall months.&nbsp;<br /><br />The lands surrounding the cabins are open to public walk-in access and other visitors may be in the vicinity during your stay.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>Visitors are invited to fish, canoe and hike around the lakes on the property. All California Department of Fish and Game and U.S. Forest Service regulations apply.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is a barn, hay shed and horse corrals onsite to accommodate visitors with horses, as well as a pasture located adjacent to th",

Beautiful trails through old-growth sequoias meander along Bear Creek and the Tule River. This grove is fairly easy to get to by driving paved roads in your car. You can visit this grove year round, but there may be snow and ice on the roads in winter so bring your tire chains. The grove is about 4,666 acres. There are several trails through this grove, including Forest Trail 31E30 and 31E31. Forest Trail 31E30 goes through the heart of the grove along the river and can be started at Belknap or Quaking Aspen campgrounds. You can stop and fish the Tule River along this trail.</p><p><strong>Nearby Campgrounds</strong>: Belknap (GPS NAD 83: 36.14167, -118.59972), Coy Flat (GPS NAD 83: 36.12917, -118.61806), Quaking Aspen (GPS NAD 83: 36.12083, -118.54722)</p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#f7f1c2\"><td valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\"><strong>Season:</strong></td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"70%\">April through November</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"><strong>Distance:</strong></td><td valign=\"top\">1.5 miles to the junction</td></tr><tr bgcolor=\"#f7f1c2\"><td valign=\"top\"><strong>Elevation:</strong></td><td valign=\"top\">Trail head - 5,000 feet<br />Bear Ridge Junction - 6,000 feet<br />Gain - 1,000 feet</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"><strong>Difficulty (hiking): </strong></td><td valign=\"top\">Up, Diffic",

Enjoy shoreline camping and day use activities at Auxiliary Dam, Old Isabella Road, or South Fork Recreation Area with the purchase of a Southern Sierra Pass or other Interagency Pass. South Fork Wildlife Area, one of the most extensive riparian woodlands remaining in California, provides fishing, hunting, canoeing, and hiking opportunities; no developed recreation facilities are located here.
