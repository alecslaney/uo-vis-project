Follow the AT/LT, blazed with white, south on the relatively flat 2-mile hike back to the parking area at Forest Road 10.&nbsp; Please practice Leave No Trace ethics, such as carry out what you carry in.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5315083.pdf\">Little Rock Pond/Green Mountain Loop Recreation Opportunity Guide</a></p>",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "The Lye Brook Wilderness is east of Manchester Center in the southern Green Mountains of Vermont. This wilderness is named after Lye Brook, which flows through its western half. The wilderness ranges from 900 feet to 2900 feet above sea level. Most is above 2500 feet, on a high plateau with several ponds and bogs. Waterfalls and rocky streams may be found here as well as reflecting pools. The western section is extremely steep, facing west-northwest towards U.S. Route 7 and Manchester. Four and a half miles of the Appalachian/Long Trail cross the northwest tip of the wilderness. Approximately 80% of the area is forested with northern hardwoods: birch, beech, and maple. Thickets of small spruce dot the area. Remnants of railroad grades and old logging roads remain. Several species of neotropical birds, black bear, moose, deer, pine martin and bobcat inhabit these woods. There are many marshy areas off trail and the ecological balance is quite fragile. Take care and be prepared for muddy trails and an intense black fly season in the spring and early summer. Hunting opportunities for deer bring many seasonal visitors, as do snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in the winter months. ",

Management of the area is shared between the Mendocino National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management, Arcata Field Office.</p><p>The Yuki Wilderness ranges in elevation from almost 6,500 feet near Windy Gap in the southeast to roughly 1,150 feet along the Middle Fork Eel River. When visiting the Yuki you will experience a wide variety of vegetation, including grasslands, chaparral thickets, oak groves and forests of Shasta red fir, white fir, Jeffrey pine, sugar pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and incense cedar. Six of California&#39;s fifteen species of oaks are found within the Yuki Wilderness.</p><p>If you visit during the spring months the Yuki will delight you with its spectacular wildflower displays! The Middle Fork Eel Wild and Scenic River flows through the northwestern portion of the Yuki Wilderness, and is home to rainbow trout, and threatened runs of steelhead and Chinook salmon. It is estimated that the river supports over one-third of California&#39;s remaining summer-run steelhead trout population. In addition, many interesting animals call the area home, including bald eagle, pine marten, goshawk, northern spotted owl, prairie falcon, river otter, beaver, tule elk, mountain lion, black bear, porcupine, ringtail, gray fox, badger, golden eagle, blue grouse and pileated woodpecker. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/STELPRDB5180361.pdf\">PDF MAP &raquo;</a></p>",

The Great Sanhedrin was the supreme council of the ancient Hebrews and the imposing ridge that crowns this Wilderness was named after that high council. The terrain in this area is moderately steep and rugged. The Wilderness is managed by the Forest Service, but includes areas of private land.</p><p>Elevations in the Wilderness vary from 6,175 feet at Big Signal peak to 1,600 along Thomas Creek. The major creeks in the area drain westward to the Eel River. Soils are moderately to highly erodible, and an unstable fault zone transects the Rocky Point-Ascherman Ranch area.</p><p><strong>Trails in the Sanhedrin</strong><br />Developed trails do not exist within the Sanhedrin at this time, providing a truly untrammeled Wilderness experience. The only public access point for this area is by the lookout on Big Signal Peak at the end of Forest Road 20N04. From this location, visitors can enjoy off trail hunting, hiking, and camping activities.</p><p>Although you may come across an old road or cattle trail while visiting the Sanhedrin, no managed trails existed upon designation of the Wilderness. Employees and wilderness stewardship volunteers have begun to identify potential opportunities to designate and maintain foot and horse trails in the Sanhedrin for future use and enjoyment.</p><p>We recommend that when visiting the area you bring the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic maps that cover the region:&nbsp; USGS maps for the Sanhedrin Wilderness include Sanhedrin Mountain, Brushy Mountain, Foster Mountain, and Van Arsdale Reservoir. <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5181589.pdf\">PDF MAP &raquo;</a></p>",

Although there are some steep sections, the trails are easy to hike with abundant resting places. The trail is located at the top of the Illinois Bayou River Drainage. It offers great views and a history lesson in Arkansas geology. While hiking the trail, you will see layer upon layer of sediment that was deposited when the area was under water millions of years ago. After the water receded, the land raised to form a dome called the Ozark Plateau. Since then, natural erosion has been occurring to form the Ozark Mountains. On the trail, you will see unique formations, called pedestals that were formed by weathering. These are the featured destination of this area. Kings Bluff features a large flat bluff top with a waterfall that flows over the ledge.

One of three wildernesses on the Buffalo Ranger District, it takes its name from the main creek running through the area with the rich, fertile soil along the lower creek portion near the Buffalo River. An unusual feature of the Ozark Mountains is that the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; are actually plateaus, uplifted as a unit with few folds or faults. The ruggedness of these mountains is due to erosion of the plateaus caused by swift rivers flowing between them. Topography within 1/4 mile on either side of Richland and Long Devil&rsquo;s Fork Creeks is quite rugged and scenic. Rock bluffs over 100 feet high and extending over a mile along each side of Richland Creek graphically reveal the earth&rsquo;s development. The forest cover is mostly second and third growth oak-hickory. Some scattered stands of shortleaf pine in old fields exist from when the Forest Service purchased the land in the 1930s and 1940s. There are no developed trails located in the wilderness. There is a system of old logging roads that run throughout the area and receive sporadic use. Kayakers float Richland Creek after rains have raised the creek water level. The wilderness area is known for its crystal clear creeks and waterfalls. Remember to take drinking water or a filtration device with you for your safety.</p>",

The area is generally flat, with some steep slopes near drainage and lies along Crowley&#39;s Ridge. Drainage areas are common and prone to flood during periods of heavy rainfall. Two large lakes and 3 major rivers flow through the area. Access is by walking in on closed roads or foot trails that lead into the heart of the hunting area. There are numerous wildlife openings that are maintained year round to provide diverse and healthy wildlife habitats. Several developed and dispersed recreation areas provide camping opportunities.</p><p>Some land along the borders of the St. Francis Walk-In Turkey Hunting Area is privately owned. Hunters are asked to respect private land boundaries shown on forest service maps.</p><p>All interior roads leading into the walk-in turkey area are closed permanently in this region.

A system of old lodging roads that runs throughout the area provides and informal network of trails for hiking and horseback rising. There are four developed access points to reach the Upper Buffalo Wilderness : Hawksbill Crag, Kapark Cemetery, Dahl Memorial, and Boen Gulf. Point of interest- Hawksbill Crag Rock Formation.</p>",

President Franklin D. Roosevelt formed the CCC during the Great Depression. Wind, rain, and natural elements caused the deterioration of the buildings over the years. In 1987 a volunteer group, Friends of White Rock, began a project to renovate the structures. With a lot of hard work, the cabins and lodge were restored in 1991. Visitors to White Rock Mountain enjoy scenic views from the cabins. White Rock Mountain is 2,260 feet above sea level and received its name from the appearance of the lichen on the sheer bluffs that look white from a distance. High bluffs surround this area. Please use caution while along the bluff line, especially with small children. White Rock Mountain is the hub of several trail systems. It offers a 13.4-mile loop trail south to Shores Lake and returns to intersect with the Ozark Highlands Trail. Around the rim of the mountaintop is a 1.5-mile loop trail. 3 rental cabins and a lodge. All three feature stone fireplaces and original furniture. The lodge can accommodate up to 30 people a night and is accessible to the physically challenged. The cabins can be rented year-round. 8 family camping units with tent pads and fire pits and one group site that will accommodate up to 10 guests. 8 family picnicking units.<br />Check out White Rock Mountain at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whiterockmountain.com/\">http://www.whiterockmountain.com/</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm8_042829.pdf\">White Rock Mountain Recreation Area Guide</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd600030.pdf\">White Rock Mountain Recreation Area Guide - Spanish</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/osfnf/recreation/?cid=fseprd637175\">Campground and Day-Use Area Rules</a></p>",

This area was first protected in 1931 when it was classified as a primitive area. Further protection was given when this area became part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, created by the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. The Wilderness Act of 1984 added another 2,000 acres to the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness, for a total of about 151,626 acres.</p><p>The Wilderness is roughly oval in shape, being about 19 miles long in the north-south direction and 24 miles wide in the east-west direction. The majority of the Wilderness lies in two districts of the Mendocino National Forest (Covelo and Grindstone Ranger Districts). The far northern portion of the Wilderness is in the Yolla Bolly&nbsp;Ranger District of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. To the far west, a part of the Wilderness is in the Mad River Ranger District of the Six Rivers National Forest, and the Bureau of Land Management has a small portion of the Wilderness (also on the western edge).</p><p>The lowest point of the Wilderness is along Cottonwood Creek (2,600&#39; elevation). This is just four and a half miles from the highest point, Mount Linn, at an elevation of 8,092 feet. Several other peaks push their way above 7,000 feet and provide fine views (weather and smoke permitting) of Mount Lassen, Mount Shasta, the Trinity Alps, the Kings Range and sometimes the Pacific Ocean.</p>",

The Snow Mountain Wilderness straddles the summit of the North Coast Range within Colusa, Glenn and Lake counties. The area is less than a four-hour drive from San Francisco, Santa Rosa, and Sacramento.</p><p>The central feature of this wilderness is the large broad topped Snow Mountain, which drains water toward the Sacramento River on the east and the Eel River Basin on the west. The wilderness also has the largest known waterfall on the forest. Elevations range from 1,800 feet in the gorge of the Middle Fork of Stony Creek to 7,056 feet on the summit of East Snow Mountain Peak. The deep canyons skirting the Wilderness compress ecological life zones creating a unique biological sky-island.</p><p>Forty miles of trail are located in the wilderness. This leaves a vast amount of acreage very remote and highly conducive to cross-country exploration. The moderate hike to the top of East Peak affords visitors a magnificent view of the Sacramento Valley and the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east, Clear Lake to the southwest, the Coastal Mountains to the west, and the timbered mountains of the Mendocino National Forest to the North.</p><p>Good drinking water is scarce in the Snow Mountain Wilderness during much of the summer. Plan ahead and refill canteens at every opportunity. Mountain streams may look inviting but they may not be safe for drinking. Treat all water for drinking and cooking by either processing through a portable water filter or by boiling over a portable cook stove.</p>",

The western boundary is shared with the Lower Buffalo Wilderness, which is administered by the National Park Service and is part of the Buffalo National River. There are 6 creeks within the Leatherwood Wilderness, which are separated by some of the most rugged, high ridgetop terrain in the Ozarks. They are characterized by steep-sided ridges over 1,200 ft high. Many are with long exposed sides of sheer vertical rock face and benches, giving the appearance of large stairsteps dropping into the drainage below. Elevation varies from 1,300 ft above sea level on the highest ridgetops to 420 ft where Leatherwood Creek exits the Wilderness. The forest is spotted with stands of native shortleaf pine as well as the unique cedar glades nestled within the primarily oak, gum, and hickory forest. There are no developed trails, but several old roads offer access into the wilderness. Points of Interest - Buffalo National River: was the country&#39;s first national river. Lower Buffalo Wilderness: expect to see&nbsp;bluffs, waterfalls, and old cabin sites.

Visitors can tour the bonebed enclosure and discover the mysterious past of the&nbsp;<em>Bison antiquus</em>&nbsp;(extinct bison) that died here.</p><p>A rancher first brought attention to the bonebed in 1954. This started an ongoing quest to discover what caused the death of so many bison. Archeologists continue to research the exact nature of past events and the role that ancient Paleo-Indian people may have played in them. While theories are plentiful, there is still no clear answer to the mystery. The Hudson-Meng Education and Research Center&rsquo;s Bison Bonebed Tour encourages visitors to develop their own ideas based on the evidence presented.</p><p>The Bison Trail connects the Hudson-Meng visitor center to Toadstool Geologic Park. This is an unforgettable three-mile (one way) hike across the Oglala Grassland. Toadstool Geologic Park is well-known for its unusual rock formations and fossils. The natural history dates as far back as 30 million years ago.&nbsp;The site is located in the shadow of Nebraska&#39;s picturesque Pine Ridge, overlooking the Oglala and Buffalo Gap National Grasslands and north to the Black Hills of South Dakota.&nbsp;</p><p>This site is an important partner of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fossilfreeway.net/\">Fossil Freeway</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>If you make a discovery on a national grassland or national forest, make sure of its location and report it right away to the nearest Forest Service office.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wM7gKaUP2dw\" width=\"350\"></iframe></p>",

In addition to the original 13.75 mile section, the trail now extends from Barkshed Campground, upstream along the creek to a new trailhead on Cripple Turkey Road where it intersects the Ozark Highlands Trail. The ten mile extension was completed in 2006, largely through the efforts of the Ozark Society and American Hiking Society in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service. Three trailheads are located within the District&rsquo;s developed recreation areas: Blanchard Springs, Gunner Pool, and Barkshed. Camping is available only within developed sites at the recreation areas, but primitive camping is allowed at the Allison and Cripple Turkey Trailheads. With caution, the access roads for the extension can be negotiated in almost any vehicle. The roads are gravel, narrow, rough, and not populated or heavily traveled. Cole Fork Road is subject to flooding, and caution should always be used crossing Cole Fork Creek near the end of the road.</p>",

The area offers picnic facilities and the Alum Cove National Recreation Trail for your enjoyment. This looping trail wanders past the natural arch, across a small stream and to the trip hike for 0.4 miles to view the arch.</p><p>Exercise caution while hiking along the bluff line. Early settlers reportedly used this arch to move their wagons and livestock across the streambed during wet weather. Water and wind also shaped other interesting rock formations along the bluff line across the cove, including the cave (or &quot;rooms&quot; as they are often called) or overhangs.&nbsp; Native Americans used these rock overhangs for shelter while on extended hunting trips. At one time, free-roaming goats inhabited the caves, giving the formations the local name, &quot;goat houses.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm8_042749.pdf\">Alum Cove Natural Bridge Geological Area Guide</a></p>",

The most unique feature of East Fork Wilderness is the presence of 3 upland ponds. These areas have exposed standing water during wet weather months and support plant communities normally encountered only in bottomlands. Some of the most beautiful scenery can be found by following the hollows upward from the creek. Waterfalls from a few feet to 20 feet high are common in these hollows. In some places the creeks are bordered by high, sheer sandstone bluffs. White oak, red oak and hickory are the principal hardwoods. Hiking is a popular recreational activity in this wilderness, as well as horseback riding.</p>",

Baden-Powell.&nbsp;</p><p>The trail is the most difficult route to the summit but is the most popular way to reach the top. This 8-mile trek features 35 switchbacks up the north face of one of the tallest mountains in the San Gabriels. Those attempting this &quot;must-do&quot; hike will find the beginning part of the hike the most difficult with the rest being slightly easier. The trail will take backpackers under the spine of the ridge through stands of Jeffrey, Ponderosa, and Lodgepole pines. What&#39;s more, be sure to stop and admire the 1,500-year-old Limber pine at the timberline.&nbsp;</p><p>Fun fact: Mt. Baden-Powell is named after Lord Robert Baden-Powell in 1931.

There are picnic tables, grills&nbsp;and bear proof trash cans for your convenience.</p><p>Balsam Glade Picnic Site was named by an early American settler, who mistook the white fir that grows here, for balsam fir, as they are similar in appearance. He called this area &ldquo;Balsam Glade&rdquo; for so long that the name stuck.<br /><br />From 1935 to 1941 the YMCA operated a summer camp for boys here. One young man who attended the camp as a youth, later became a counselor for boys at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; camp. He was a fun loving fellow and gained the title &ldquo;Ghost of the Sandia&rsquo;s&rdquo; for his wild antics, like flying over the campfire on a zip line and scaring the campers. The only evidence of the &lsquo;Y&rsquo; camp are two sets of steps that led hundreds of hungry kids into the dining hall and out again to make more memories.</p><p>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) has a rich history and lasting presence throughout the Sandia&rsquo;s. In their honor, we ask that you take extra care to &ldquo;Leave No Trace&rdquo; when you visit.</p><ul><li>Additional dispersed picnic areas, which do not require a reservation, are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</li><li><strong>No Camping Allowed</strong></li></ul>",

A daily amenity fee of $3.00 is required for all vehicles parking in designated, developed recreation sites around the District.

They serve as a premier refuge to a population of over 700,000 people in the extended metropolitan area. Over one-third of the State&#39;s school-age population lives within an hour&#39;s drive of the Sandias, and there is a great demand for fire prevention, fire ecology, and other environmental education programs.</p><p>Sandia Mountain is a landmark in the spiritual universe of many active traditional Indian beliefs. It is regularly visited for ceremonial purposes by the Sandia Pueblo and at least annually by many other pueblos.

It is located at the northeast end of the Sandia Ranger District. It is, understandably, a favorite place for many. Las Huertas Creek meanders year round through this recreation site. Pathways and foot bridges lead over the water and through the trees to dispersed picnic tables and grills that are tucked away in the woods. The group site pavilion is a replica of the 1930s Civilian Conservation Corps design.&nbsp;<br /><br />Las Huertas was a &ldquo;side camp&rdquo; for the Civilian Conservation Corps from 1933 to 1941. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) has a rich history and lasting presence throughout the Sandia&rsquo;s. In their honor, we ask that you take extra care to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\">Leave No Trace</a>&rdquo; when you visit.</p><p><br /><strong>Natural Features</strong>: The site is located on the east side of the Sandia Mountains, at an elevation of 7,600 feet. Las Huertas is adjacent to the only year-round stream in the range and can be heard throughout the picnic area. The water draws birds and other wildlife to the picnic grounds. Aspen and fir trees surround the area, providing shade from the sun.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Picnicking and bird watching are favorite pastimes at this site.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>:</p><ul><li>Drinkable water and electricity, firewood /charcoal are not available at the site.</li><li>Accessible vault toilets and bear proof trash receptacles are provided.</li></ul><p>The picnic pavilion can accommodate up to 30 people. It is equipped with multiple picnic tables and grills.</p><ul><li>Additional dispersed picnic areas, which do not require a reservation, are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Each area can accommodate a small family group and have no covering. Tables and grills provided.</li></ul>",

The fire burned all of the supporting wood frame of the lookout cab underneath its metal exterior. The tower is no longer safe for visitors. Forest Service officials are uncertain at this time if the structure will be rebuilt.</p><p>Tater Knob Fire Tower was the last remaining fire tower on the Daniel Boone National Forest. It was built in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps as a lookout for detecting forest fires. The cab of this 35-ft. tower was home to the lookout operators who staffed it during the fire season. In a space less than 200 square feet, the cab had just enough room for a wood stove, two cots, a cabinet, storage box, small table, and a stool. The all-important alidade, or fire finder, stood in the middle of the room.</p><p>Tater Knob Fire TowerThe original wooden cab was reconstructed in 1959, reduced to nearly half its original size. The lookouts no longer lived in the tower. Instead, they climbed to the peak of Tater Knob every day of the fire season to watch for smoke. By the mid-1970s, aircraft became the new method for spotting forest fires. The fire towers, including Tater Knob, were abandoned from use.</p><p>The tower is currently listed on the National Historic Lookout Register.</p><p>Learn more about fire towers by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.firelookout.org/\">Forest Fire Lookout Association website.</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5276780.pdf\">Cave Run Lake area map</a></p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>",

This area is open to ATV use on designated roads and trails. Please help prevent erosion and soil compaction by staying on roads and main driving trails. Driving on the meadows creates ruts or channels that water flows through, removing topsoil and creating scars tht last many lifetimes. Delicate meadow plants can be damaged, leaving less forage for wildlife and leaving the soil unprotected. when riders drive through the trees and around them in circles the soil becomes compacted, depriving root systems of water and air, this will eventually kill the tree.</p>",

This created great pressure that, when aimed at the hillside, washed tons of dirt, rock and gold into the miners sluice boxes where the gold was collected. The river access here has an information board and a gravel ramp to the water's edge. The Ft. Goff Campground is less than 1 mile downstream on Hwy 96. It has 5 walk-in campsites, a vault toilet, tables and fireplaces.</p>",
