The axe was king, and engineering feats in the mountains included lumber mills, water flumes, steam locomotives, and unrivalled will power. This grove is the largest contiguous grove in the world and contains Boole Tree, the largest sequoia on National Forest System land. This grove offers unique opportunities to study how rapidly the young sequoias grow. Unlike most of the planet&rsquo;s other species, sequoias reproduce prolifically and continue to grow rapidly well into old age. Converse Basin also offers the importance of studying historic weather patterns created from the timelines on tree rings located on the stumps.<br />Nearby Campgrounds: Princess Campground (GPS NAD 83: 36.80278, -118.93694)</p><p>In the late 1800s, the Converse Basin Grove was under private ownership, and was harvested extensively during our country&rsquo;s historic logging period. Several groups of sequoias escaped the 1880s logging. Much of the grove was cut down, denuded and the land was later sold to the U.S. Forest Service. Today, the grove has recovered and it is breathtaking!<br />Recreation Opportunities: There are quite of few areas to get out and explore! Hume Lake, Drive the Kings Canyon Scenic Byway, or camp nearby in Princess Campground. There are also a few dispersed camping areas which people are welcome to use, please check with the Hume Lake Ranger District office.<br />Three prominent developed recreation sites lie within Converse Basin Grove; the Boole Tree Trail, Chicago Stump Trail, and Stump Meadow. For the history buffs, buy a copy of the book, They Felled the Redwoods which has extensive historical information.<br />Boole Tree Trail is a moderate 2.5 mile loop to the Boole Tree.

More than half these visitors ride the Sandia Peak Tram or drive the Sandia Crest National Scenic Byway to take in spectacular panoramic views of Central New Mexico and to enjoy many other recreational opportunities. The Sandia Crest Scenic Byway 536,&nbsp;has several newly remodeled picnic grounds with shelters and group areas for reservation.</p><p>The National Fee Project is currently in operation for all developed sites on the Scenic Byway and along the west and north sides of the district inthe Juan Tabo, Basin, and Las Huertas Canyon Areas. A daily amenity fee of $3.00 is required for all vehicles parking in designated, developed recreation sites around the District. An annual pass is favorable, with particular support given to the concept of fees staying available to the unit where they are collected.&nbsp; The annual Sandia Ranger District Amenity pass is $30.00 and can be purchased at the Sandia Ranger Station, Tijeras, NM, the Forest Service Supervisor&#39;s Office, Albuquerque, NM, and REI, Albuquerque, NM.</p><p>The Sandias are part of the signature of Albuquerque&#39;s unique sense of place. They serve as a premier refuge to a population of over 700,000 people in the extended metropolitan area. Over one-third of the State&#39;s school-age population lives within an hour&#39;s drive of the Sandias, and there is a great demand for fire prevention, fire ecology, and other environmental education programs.</p><p>Sandia Mountain is a landmark in the spiritual universe of many active traditional Indian beliefs. It is regularly visited for ceremonial purposes by the Sandia Pueblo and at least annually by many other pueblos. It also has direct ties to Spanish land grant communities established by the King of Spain in the 1700&#39;s and Mexican land grants from the 1820&#39;s. Some Spanish land grants adjoining the Sandias are still active.</p><p>Water sources are not only ",

It is located at the northeast end of the Sandia Ranger District. It is, understandably, a favorite place for many. Las Huertas Creek meanders year round through this recreation site. Pathways and foot bridges lead over the water and through the trees to dispersed picnic tables and grills that are tucked away in the woods. The group site pavilion is a replica of the 1930s Civilian Conservation Corps design.&nbsp;<br /><br />Las Huertas was a &ldquo;side camp&rdquo; for the Civilian Conservation Corps from 1933 to 1941. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) has a rich history and lasting presence throughout the Sandia&rsquo;s. In their honor, we ask that you take extra care to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles\">Leave No Trace</a>&rdquo; when you visit.</p><p><br /><strong>Natural Features</strong>: The site is located on the east side of the Sandia Mountains, at an elevation of 7,600 feet. Las Huertas is adjacent to the only year-round stream in the range and can be heard throughout the picnic area. The water draws birds and other wildlife to the picnic grounds. Aspen and fir trees surround the area, providing shade from the sun.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Picnicking and bird watching are favorite pastimes at this site.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>:</p><ul><li>Drinkable water and electricity, firewood /charcoal are not available at the site.</li><li>Accessible vault toilets and bear proof trash receptacles are provided.</li></ul><p>The picnic pavilion can accommodate up to 30 people. It is equipped with multiple picnic tables and grills.</p><ul><li>Additional dispersed picnic areas, which do not require a reservation, are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Each area can accommodate a small family group and have no covering. Tables and grills provided.</li></ul>",

He called this area &ldquo;Balsam Glade&rdquo; for so long that the name stuck.<br /><br />From 1935 to 1941 the YMCA operated a summer camp for boys here. One young man who attended the camp as a youth, later became a counselor for boys at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; camp. He was a fun loving fellow and gained the title &ldquo;Ghost of the Sandia&rsquo;s&rdquo; for his wild antics, like flying over the campfire on a zip line and scaring the campers. The only evidence of the &lsquo;Y&rsquo; camp are two sets of steps that led hundreds of hungry kids into the dining hall and out again to make more memories.</p><p>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) has a rich history and lasting presence throughout the Sandia&rsquo;s.

The current cabin was built 2 years later.&nbsp;<br /><br />The cabin is open year-round and can be accessed by car in warmer months. Guests must snowmobile to the cabin on groomed trails in the winter. Many modern conveniences are provided at the guard station, but some are seasonal and not guaranteed, so guests should be prepared to bring much of their own equipment and supplies.</p><p><strong>Natural Features: </strong>Cub River Guard Station is situated near the banks of the Cub River at an elevation of 6,000 feet. The grounds are partially shaded by mixed hardwood, pine and cottonwood trees.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wildflowers dot the landscape in warmer months. Dense thickets of willow around Cub River attract local moose, but elk and deer are also seen in the area.</p><p><strong>Recreation: </strong>Numerous hiking, biking, horse and off-road vehicle trails crisscross the area, offering great opportunities to get out and explore. The area becomes a playground for snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months. Nearby trailheads lead to several multi-use trails, including the Highline National Recreation Trail.&nbsp;Click here&nbsp;for an Idaho OHV safety message.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anglers can fly-fish for cutthroat and rainbow trout in the Cub River. Hunting areas are nearby.</p><p><strong>Facilities: </strong>The cabin can sleep eight people on the four bunk beds provided; there are no mattresses. Renters will need to provide sleeping pads and bedding. Two bunk beds are in one bedroom and can sleep four people and the other two bunk beds are in the second bedroom, sleeping four more people.

The dwelling sits in an open grassy area surrounded by the rugged mountain peaks of the Sawtooth Range, which are dotted with evergreens. The surrounding area still exhibits some signs of a past forest fire.<br /><br />Wildlife watchers may spot elk, deer, mountain goats, wolves, coyotes, cougars, bobcats and bears. The occasional wolverine may also be seen, as their numbers are growing within the Sawtooth Wilderness.</p><h4>Recreation:</h4><p>Several trails located within 2 miles of the cabin offer superb horseback riding opportunities, including the nearby Horse Heaven Trail. These trails are in varying stages of maintenance, but tend to be in good condition for at least 2 miles. Hikers can follow the river all the way to its headwaters in the Sawtooth Wilderness.

The current cabin&#39;s exterior has changed little since that time, with the exception of a metal roof being added sometime before 1984.<br /><br />The cabin is typically available between mid-April and late October, and it&#39;s accessible by car. Many modern comforts are provided at the cabin, but guests may need to bring some additional supplies and gear for their stay.</p><p>Natural Features:</p><p>Third Fork Cabin sits in a steep mountain landscape heavily forested with old-growth Ponderosa pine at an approximate elevation of 4,700 feet. Tall grasses and various hardwoods grow on the site. Small mountain streams with native fish flow nearby, and the area is marked by unusual juxtapositions of basalt and granitic rock.<br /><br />Wildlife watchers may spot elk or deer wandering through the area during dawn or dusk, as well as glimpse a bear or moose. Birders can look for a wide variety of bird species.</p><p>Recreation:</p><p>There are several mountain biking and hiking trails crisscrossing the area.

At the turn of the century, the industry developed in the Hanging Rock Iron Region of Ohio and Kentucky which became the largest iron producer in the US.</p><p>The Hanging Rock region produced iron from 1818 to 1916 and was one of three in the country capable of producing the iron needed during the Civil War. Not long after the war, the iron boom in Hanging Rock ceased. Hanging Rock&rsquo;s Vesuvius Furnace, located on today&rsquo;s Wayne National Forest, is a remnant of 1 of the 46 furnaces in the region.</p><p>The iron boom brought in workers who often lived in company towns. Company towns compensated workers with company &ldquo;money&rdquo; that could be used only within the town. Ironmasters owned the furnaces and managed company towns.</p><p>Ironmasters tended to be abolitionists and often provided support to the Underground Railroad as conductors or station masters. Furnaces and the connecting company towns provided safe havens and financial aid for freedom seekers. Several of the routes used by individuals escaping slavery were along the same paths of Ohio&rsquo;s iron furnaces.</p><p>Black Fork settlement, an iron company town located in Lawrence County, Ohio, employed mostly African Americans, some escaped slaves.

The brief dirt road leading to the cabin is actually the old stagecoach route, complete with historic graffiti that served as billboards advertising goods and services at the stagecoach stops. Though Upper Crossing Guard Station offers visitors relaxing solitude in a secluded setting, the cabin is situated near a paved highway and also offers numerous modern amenities, such as: running water, heated water, electricity, propane heat, a full bathroom (with ADA accessible shower) and ADA accessible kitchen with appliances. The cabin was recently remodeled and is the Rio Grande National Forest&#39;s most accessible facility to persons with disabilities, despite it being a remote and historic Forest Service Guard Station.

Iron was manufactured at the Illinois Furnace by the charcoal blast method. The furnace was built on a dry laid limestone foundation. The exterior of the furnace was manufactured of large limestone blocks quarried near the town of Cave-In-Rock. The interior wall, or lining, was constructed of firebrick from Pennsylvania. The space between the interior and exterior walls was filled with sandstone. Wrought iron binders were placed through the stonework and tightened to secure the walls. All of the stonework was dry laid. A 1/2 mile trail leading from the back of the picnic area features bottomland habitat and bottomland tree species. The trail winds along Big Creek and offers 2 or 3 deep old-fashioned fishing holes. Once a site of an iron making blast furnace, the picnic area contains a reconstructed blast furnace as a monument to our nation&#39;s past industry.</p>",

Among its founding members included those who aided in the defense of the Amistad captives in 1839. The AMA helped put the abolishment of slavery onto the national political agenda.</p><p>Although it was a national association, the AMA focused its financial and other resources to help Border States (where free and slave states adjoined) operate the Underground Railroad. The region of southern Illinois, including today&rsquo;s Shawnee National Forest, proved vital to their cause and became a focal point. The letters of James West, an AMA preacher, confirm that Pope County and Miller Grove were a hotbed of anti-slavery activity.</p><p>Over 300 missionaries, called &ldquo;colporteurs,&rdquo; were stationed throughout southern Illinois which they referred to as &ldquo;Egypt.&rdquo; They arrived there with aspirations of changing the hearts and minds of local citizens by preaching and passing out Bibles. They also distributed antislavery literature including their own magazine, the American Missionary, published from 1846 through 1934.</p><p>Literacy and education was a focus of the AMA. They believed that the anti-literacy laws perpetuated slavery by enslaving minds as well as bodies. During the Civil War the AMA began to build schools for freedmen. By 1866, they had chartered seven higher education institutions for African Americans and helped in the establishment of Howard University.</p><p>In 1934, the Board of Homeland Ministries absorbed the AMA.

The campground is lightly wooded with spruce trees, creating a beautiful meadow atmosphere.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Rio Grande National Forest spans 1.86 million acres in south-central Colorado. The Continental Divide runs for 236 miles along most of the forest&#39;s western border, presenting a myriad of ecosystems from alpine desert to dense wilderness.</p><p><strong>Natural Features</strong>:</p><p>The campground meanders up a mountainside above Big Meadows Reservoir in a series of 3 loops. As a sub-alpine region, the campground gets more snow melt and rainfall than the opposite side of the lake, resulting in plentiful wildflowers and aspens surrounding the campsites.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:</p><p>An accessible fishing pier, located on the north shore of the reservoir, allows anglers to cast for rainbow, brown and brook trout. Hunting, boating and hiking are also popular pastimes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hikers and horseback riders will enjoy the nearby, 6-mile Archuleta Trail. The trail accesses the Weminuche Wilderness, Colorado&#39;s largest wilderness, which boasts the headwaters of dozens of major streams and rivers that feed into the Rio Grande and San Juan rivers.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>:</p><p>Each site has a campfire ring and picnic tables. Drinking water is available.&nbsp;<br /><br />The nearest dump station is 13 miles away, and a boat ramp is located on the north shore of the reservoir.</p><p>There is a picnic area adjacent to this campground.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions:</strong></p><p>The surrounding area has plenty to keep visitors busy, with attractions like Great Sand Dunes National Park, Native American ruins,&nbsp;the Continental Divide Trail&nbsp;and gold rush ghost towns. The Sangre de Cristo and San Juan Ranges are laced with trails for&nbsp;all levels of &nbsp;hikers.</p><p><strong>Fish Your National Forests:</strong> This site can be accessed by Passen",

Within the 13,500 acre area, portions will have use restricted to a relatively dense network of designated routes which will be identified at a later date. Generally unrestricted use will be on areas devoid of vegetation or with sparse vegetation and without such things as sensitive plants, archaeological sites, critical wildlife habitat, excessively steep slopes, or visually sensitive areas.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/albums/72157656024081574\" target=\"_blank\">See photos of the the Cinder Hills OHV Area on Flickr</a>.</p>",

At 12,643 feet, the San Francisco Peaks is not only the dominant feature of the forest area we call the Volcanic Highlands, it&#39;s also the highest mountain in Arizona. Three of the summits that ring this dormant volcano&#39;s now quiet inner caldera are higher than any other mountain in the state.</p><p>This mountain is sacred to the native peoples that live in the area and its soaring profile set against a blue Arizona sky serves as a source of awe to contemporary residents and visitors. Views from the summit of the San Francisco Peaks stretch to the Grand Canyon&#39;s North Rim over eighty miles away. Hiking, sightseeing, wildlife watching and skiing are the predominant recreation activities enjoyed in this land of mountains, forests and lava flows.</p><p>Flagstaff Ranger District, extends from north of the Peaks to the south. This rolling highland is a land of ponderosa pine forests and pinyon/juniper woodlands clustered around broad prairies and small lakes. Arizona&#39;s largest natural lake, Mormon Lake, is located here. The area is also known for its plentiful wildlife. Large herds of elk roam the forests and edgelands. Bald eagles and ospreys live and hunt around the lakes. Pronghorn antelope graze the prairies.</p><p>Principal recreation activities among the lakes and prairies are boating, fishing, camping, and wildlife watching. The area also boasts some excellent cross-country skiing in good snow years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><!--<div style=\"padding: 5px; background-color: #CDF; height: 160px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/detail/coconino/recreation/wintersports/?cid=fseprd482463\"><img alt=\"Map of wintertime recreation sites around Flagstaff, Arizona\" src=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/fseprd482421.png\" style=\"width: 113px; height: 150px; float: left;\" /></a><p>See the <a href=\"/detail/coconino/recreation/w",

Along with passing out bibles and antislavery literature, he preached antislavery ideology. He was not na&iuml;ve about his work - his father, a Methodist preacher who laid the foundation for James&rsquo;s antislavery fervor, had been killed because of his views. Originally from Kentucky, West eventually moved his wife, Sarah, and their children north to Illinois after he was persecuted and abused in his hometown.</p><p>In October 1856, the family settled in Pope County, Illinois, where West taught school for a short time. In a letter to the AMA, he recognized the irony of being the only radical abolitionist teacher employed in the region that, although a Free State, held vehement hostility toward African Americans. Despite these hostilities, West continued to preach throughout the county for people to reject slavery and accept Free Blacks into their communities. His letters to the AMA board members mentions his &ldquo;friends&rdquo; in the region which most likely refers to the African American community at Miller Grove.</p><p>Although mentioning specific information about the Underground Railroad could have jeopardized the operation, his letters discuss the region as a good &ldquo;second depot&rdquo; and &ldquo;railroad.&rdquo; In his letters with Brother Jocelyn of AMA, he explains that the proximity to the river was ideal and requested additional resources and AMA members to help.</p><p>In 1860, James reported to AMA that &ldquo;colporteurs&rdquo; (someone who distributes religious or similar literatur",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>The Miller Family</p><p>The community of free African Americans in Pope County, Illinois came to be known as Miller Grove, presumably named for one of four families that settled the area.</p><p>In 1844, the Miller family helped establish a small community of rural dispersed farmsteads. Harrison Miller - the founder and patriarch of the town - brought his wife Lucinda and their three children from a Tennessee plantation to the woodlands of Pope County.</p><p>Although Harrison and his immediate family could not read nor write, education was important to him and the community of Miller Grove. Harrison served as an executor for a nearby former slave owner&rsquo;s estate; later he became the owner and the land was used for the Mt. Gilead African Methodist Episcopal Church as well as a school. Sadly, the original log church burnt down in 1918.</p><p>In 1860, the census showed Julia Singleton as a Black schoolteacher. Julia was a freed African American from Peter Singleton, one of the four original Miller Grove families. Archeologists recently found writing slates at Miller-connected sites.</p><p>Harrison and Lucinda&rsquo;s eldest son, Bedford, arrived in southern Illinois as a child and continued to live in the Miller Grove community until his death in 1911. Bedford married Abby Gill and they had four daughters. Their graves can be seen in the cemetery among a hundred others, the only lasting element of Miller Grove in today&rsquo;s Shawnee National Forest.</p><p>Other Millers included Andrew Miller and his sister, Matilda, who moved from a Tennessee plantation after being granted freedom from their owner.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p>Cheryl LaRoche, <em>Free Black Communities and the Underground Railroad: the Geography of Resistance</em></p><p>Vickie Devenport and Mary R.

The cabin offers wonderful views of Antora Peak (13,266&#39;) and Windy Point while the creek with active beaver dams just below the cabin provides enjoyable fishing for all, (please check Colorado Division of Wildlife for fishing seasons and rules). The area offers many opportunities for hiking, 4WD adventures in summer, hunting in the fall, and cross country skiing and snowmobiling in the winter. Brewery Creek Guard Station is located 2 miles from Bonanza, a historical silver mining town that was booming in the 1880&#39;s. Today visitors to Bonanza can see old mines, historical buildings, and old time mining equipment as they follow the Bonanza Mines Off-Highway Vehicle Tour (Maps for the Bonanza Off-Highway Vehicle Tour are available at the Saguache Ranger Station). Several hiking trails are also in close proximity to the cabin, including the Elkhorn Trail and several other trails leading up to Antora and Antora Meadows. Elk, deer, and other wildlife are often seen in meadows adjacent to the cabin. Renters are required to pack out all garbage. PACK IT IN, PACK IT OUT. CABIN MUST BE CLEANED BEFORE LEAVING, LEAVE THE CABIN IN THE CONDITION YOU WOULD LIKE TO FIND IT! Visitors to the National Forest are responsible for knowing the rules and regulations of the forest.

Not only will you be helping your chances by changing location, but each of these bodies of water is known for producing a different species of fish. The three shallow lakes in this group serve forest visitors as places to set up a primitive camp and go fishing. <strong>Soldier Lake</strong> provides good fishing for bass and catfish. <strong>Soldier Annex Lake</strong> is better known for its catfish, although blue gill can also be caught here. <strong>Long Lake</strong> is the only one of the three that is stocked with trout but is also good for walleye and catfish.</p><p>Many forest visitors come here to set up primitive camps and enjoy other forest activities besides fishing, such as off highway vehicle riding and wildlife watching. The lakes are located in an area of open grasslands dotted with pinyon and juniper trees.</p><p><strong>Campground Season</strong>: There are no developed campgrounds at these lakes. The nearest developed campground is Blue Ridge Campground which is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day.</p><p><strong>Attractions</strong>: Boating/canoeing, fishing, wildlife watching</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Valut-type toilets and two boat ramps at Long Lake.</p><p><strong>Helpful Links from the <a href=\"http://www.azgfd.gov/\">Arizona Game &amp; Fish Department</a>: </strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://boat-ed.com/az/handbook/\">Handbook of Boating Laws and Responsibilities</a> - the official Arizona boating handbook</li><li><a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaw",

There is no potable water so campers should come prepared with plenty of drinking water. To reach the campground cross the Skagit River Bridge at the town of Marblemount and head east along the Cascade River road for approximately 15 miles.</p>",

In 1913, Tommy Thompson was the Assistant Ranger of the Suiattle-Finney District. As a ranger, one of his tasks was to construct his own station. He used hand-split shakes and log construction to supplement purchased building materials. Because of budget limitations, the Forest Service often relied upon rangers to construct their own stations. Construction details on the Suiattle Guard Station, such as the half-dovetail notching, is a tribute to Ranger Thompson`s craftsmanship. As a testament, the cabin survives to this day as one of the two oldest administrative buildings in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The Suiattle Guard Station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.</p>",

Three miles in from the Chain Lakes/Ptarmigan Ridge junction the Ptarmigan Ridge Trail reaches the base of Coleman Pinnacle. The trail continues another half mile to Camp Kiser. Beyond this point, a primitive boot path, recommended for experienced mountaineers, leads to advanced climbing routes on Mt. Baker.</p><p>The snow on this route does not melt until late in the season and the five-mile approach can be a long, difficult slog through heavy snow in steep chutes. The trek becomes less difficult but route finding becomes more so as the season progresses and the snow melts. Despite impeding snow, this route is best climbed early in the season before the glacier becomes broken up and extensively crevassed.</p><p>This route is within the <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mbs/recarea/?recid=79421\">Mt.
