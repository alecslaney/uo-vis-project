The mines are hazardous, so do not enter them. The chimney in the wood picnic shelter is all that remains of a farmhouse the once occupied this site. The exceptional craftsmanship of civilian works programs are evident in the wood shelter that was built by Job Corps in the late 1960s. The foundation and chimney stone from the old farm house were used to form the original picnic shelter. The farmhouse was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. In exchange for the building of the house the owners agreed to sell what is now Alpine Picnic Area to the federal government. The house was eventually torn down in the early 1960s.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/dbnf/?cid=fseprd606571\"><img alt=\"Send Your Photos\" src=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/fseprd611543.jpg\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 106px;\" /></a></p><p>Make this page look nicer by <a href=\"mailto:gwen.hensley@usda.gov?subject=Alpine%20Picnic%20Area%20photos&amp;body=I've%20attached%20my%20photos%20of%20Alpine%20Picnic%20Area",

Hunters must use muzzle-loading firearms, bows or crossbows to hunt and harvest wild game,&nbsp;like&nbsp;Native Americans and early settlers would have hunted.</p><p>The national forest lands in this area are managed for multiple-use, but wildlife management is a major emphasis. To enhance the area for wildlife, grassy openings and waterholes have been created and maintained. Timber management is used to create habitat diversity.</p><p>The area boundaries are marked with yellow signs and yellow bands painted on trees.

There is no drinking water at this site. You need to&nbsp;bring your own water.<br />Points of Interest: Middle Lion Campground is particularly beautiful in the fall. As the trees change color, you will find yourself surrounded by vibrant yellow hues! If you enjoy hiking there are several trails for you to choose from near the campground.</p><p>The Lion Canyon Trail (22W06) starts at the back of the campground. After 1.3 miles you will reach the Rose Lion Connector Trail (22W16) on the right. After 0.6 miles you can take side trails to East Fork Lion Camp, which is within the Sespe Wilderness, or West Fork Lion Camp. The main trail continues 3.6 miles to Nordhoff Ridge for spectacular views. No mountain bikes are allowed in the wilderness.</p><p>One mile away on the Rose Valley Road (6N31) is the Piedra Blanca trailhead where are three trails to explore. All three trails are located across Sespe Creek. The Gene Marshall-Piedra Blanca National Recreation Trail (22W03) in the Sespe Wilderness will lead you to nearby massive white rocks, called Piedra Blanca! It is an easy walk for the first three miles.</p><p>Another trail, the Sespe River Trail (20W13) will lead you downstream into the Sespe Wilderness. You will find some swimming holes along this walk. Remember, no mountain bicycles allowed on wilderness trails. If you would like to go on a mountain bicycle ride, take the Middle Sespe Trail (22W04) that leads up river 8 miles to the west to Middle Sespe Trailhead.</p><p>Fire Use:<strong> </strong>Middle Lion Campground is a &quot;Campfire Use Site.&quot; Campfires are normally permitted year around without a California Campfire ",

The Lower Manzana Trailhead leads to a historical schoolhouse, last used in 1901. In close proximity to the schoolhouse, one will also find a historical hunting lodge known as the Dabney Cabin. This trail is also very popular for backpackers and horseback riders, as there are many primitive campsites throughout the connecting trails. The parking area is in a wide turnout within 50 feet of the trailhead and accommodates between 12 to 15 vehicles. During heavy rainfalls, the trailhead may be inaccessible.</p>",

On December 19, 2002 the Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002 added 33,967 acres to the existing wilderness bringing it to a total of 240, 026 acres. Topography of the Ventana Wilderness is characterized by steep-sided, sharp-crested ridges separating V-shaped youthful valleys. Most streams fall rapidly through narrow, vertical-walled canyons flowing on bedrock or a veneer of boulders. Waterfalls, deep pools and thermal springs are found along major streams. Elevations range from 600 feet, where the Big Sur River leaves the Wilderness, to about 5,750 feet at the Wilderness boundary circumventing Junipero Serra Peak. Marked vegetation changes occur within the Wilderness. These changes are attributed to dramatic climate and topographic variations coupled with an extensive fire history. Much of the damage to vegetation is only temporary, since fire is an integral part of this Wilderness as it is of other areas of the Forest. Much of the Ventana is covered by chaparral. This brushy vegetative cover is typical of that found throughout Southern California fire susceptible mountains. The contrast of annual grass meadows and open pine stands may be found throughout the Wilderness. Deep narrow canyons cut by the fast moving Big and Little Sur Rivers support virgin stands of coastal redwood. Small scattered stands of the endemic Bristlecone Fir may be found on rocky slopes.</p>",

Much of the soil here is sandy and often wet. Wildflowers such as orchids, pitcher plants, and sundews flourish. These savannahs are some of the most botanically rich areas in the country. Do you know that Florida has about 3,500 species of wildflowers?</p><p>The byway begins 9 miles south of Bristol on State Road 12. From State Road 12, turn onto State Road 379 heading south to the town of Sumatra. Travel through the flat-to-gently rolling terrain. Stop and explore bays of magnolia and cypress, groves of oaks, or stands of longleaf pine that thrive in the sandhills and flatwoods. History buffs enjoy visiting <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/apalachicola/recarea/?recid=75221\">Fort Gadsden Historic Site </a>near the southern end of the byway.</p><p>The byway is ecologically important as a showcase for one of the largest remaining blocks of natural longleaf pine/wiregrass communities in existence. Longleaf forest surrounded with lush wiregrass once stretched from Virginia through Florida and west to Texas. Today, only enough longleaf forests remain to fill an area the size of Virginia, much of it right here in north Florida.</p><p>Endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers, fox squirrels, black bears, bobcats, wild turkeys, gray foxes, raccoons, and alligators are at home in the diversified ecosystems of the Apalachee Savannahs Scenic Byway.

If you plan on visiting Minnetonka Cave please DO NOT wear any clothing (including shoes, hats, belts, jewelry) or bring any items with you (such as cameras, backpacks, cell phones, purses, etc) that have been in another cave or mine. This precaution is in place to protect the native bats from White Nose Syndrome. We appreciate your cooperation and hope you enjoy your tour.</em></strong></p><p>Due to the westward spread of White Nose syndrome (WNS), restrictions on clothing and items that have been in other caves are currently in place at Minnetonka Cave to prevent introduction of this bat disease into Idaho. It is possible for humans to spread the disease between caves if clothing or equipment has been exposed to the fungus. Leaving clothing or other items that have been in another cave at home will help protect bat species inhabiting Minnetonka Cave. Introduction of this disease into Minnetonka Cave would devastate local bat populations, and in the event of a cave closure, greatly impact local economies.

The area around the clear, spring-fed lake offers both a day-use area for swimming, picnicking, and hiking, and a campground in a beautiful forest setting along one portion of the lakeshore. It is perfect for fishing and boating. Swimmers can enjoy the white sand beach, and a nearby bathhouse includes flush toilets and hot showers. Picnic tables and grills are scattered among trees with views of the lake.</p><p>The campground includes 18 campsites with picnic tables, grills, tent pads and fire rings. The recreation area is fairly level and easily accessible. Hikers can enjoy a 4.6-mile interpretive trail that circles the lake.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3829573.pdf\">Check out our brochure to learn more about all there is to do around Wright Lake!</a></strong> (pdf)</p>",

Rare species of plants and animals can be found at Silver Lake, but the observant visitor is more likely to see turtles, alligators, bears, turkeys, and armadillos.</p><p>Silver Lake is in the Munson Sandhills, which are composed of deep dry sands that have accumulated over limestone. Because the sand absorbs rainfall so completely, wetlands are relatively rare in this part of the forest. In places, the limestone dissolves and collapses, forming the depressions and ponds, lakes and sinkholes that are common in the area.</p><p>Camping is not allowed at Silver Lake, but restrooms&nbsp;are available.

Keep an eye out for resident wildlife such as moose and deer.</p><p><strong>Attention! In an attempt to keep White Nose Syndrome (a bat disease) from spreading into Minnetonka Cave, please DO NOT wear clothing or hand carried items into Minnetonka Cave that you have worn or carried in any other cave or mine. These things include &ndash; shoes, hats, belts, jewelry, cameras, backpacks, cell phones, purses, etc. Any individuals who bring items with them that have been in another cave or mine will not be able to take the tour. We appreciate your cooperation and hope you enjoy your tour.</strong></p><p>Due to the westward spread of White Nose syndrome (WNS), restrictions on clothing and items that have been in other caves are currently in place at Minnetonka Cave to prevent introduction of this bat disease into Idaho. It is possible for humans to spread the disease between caves if clothing or equipment has been exposed to the fungus. Leaving clothing or other items that have been in another cave at home, will help protect bat species inhabiting Minnetonka Cave. Introduction of this disease into Minnetonka Cave would devastate local bat populations, and in the event of a cave closure, greatly impact local economies.

Located along the Apalachicola River, this interpretive area offers detailed information about the site and its history along with trails, river access, and a picnic area.</p><p>Built during the War of 1812,&nbsp;the British&nbsp;Fort was placed in a strategic spot along the Apalachicola River, which was the &quot;highway for commerce&quot; in those pre-road, pre-railroad days.</p><p>On July 27, 1816, U.S. Navy forces led by Colonel Duncan Clinch fired on what was then called &quot;The Negro Fort.&quot; One of the early shots from the ship&#39;s guns landed on a ammunition shed inside the fort, resulting in a massive explosion which left only 33 survivors to tell the tale.</p><p>In 1818, Lt. James Gadsden oversaw construction of a new fort on the site as a U.S. fort in the heart of Spanish territory, under the auspices of Major General Andrew Jackson. This fort, Fort Gadsden, remained in use until 1821, when Florida became a U.S. Territory.</p><p>Detailed interpretive information in the form of kiosks and signage lead you through the site of both forts and the cemetery where the victims from 1816 are buried.</p><p>Interested in learning more of the story? <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprd3828073.pdf\">Here&#39;s an interpretive brochure</a> (PDF).</p><!--<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpoFQY16a0E?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>&lt;--/p&gt; </p>-->",

The narrow passages, rocky climbs and an occasional mud hole keep the trail rated as Most Difficult. The trail is recommended for short wheelbase vehicles with all skid plates in place, and even then, you can expect scratches and/or dents. There are restrooms located at the trailhead.

Above the forest, mountain peaks rise into the sky.<br /><br />Many wildlife species make their home here. Elk, deer, moose, bear and a variety of other animals frequent the forest. Snowshoe hares and ermine are active in winter, though they may be hard to spot with their white winter coats.</p><h4>Recreation:</h4><p>Beautiful Warm Lake is less than 5 miles from the cabin, offering boating, canoeing and fishing for rainbow, cutthroat, lake and bull trout. Billy Rice Swim Beach, on the north shore of the lake, is a great day-use site for picnicking and swimming. Numerous hiking, biking, horse and off-road vehicle trails crisscross the area around the lake. <a href=\"http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/safety.htm\">Click here</a> for an Idaho OHV safety message.<br /><br />A popular activity is to soak in nearby Vulcan Hot Springs, about 1.5 miles away. Winter activities include snowshoeing, cross-country skiing and sledding. Hunting season brings out hunters in search of big game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4><p>Near Stolle Meadows is a South Fork Salmon River site where visitors can watch Chinook salmon spawn every August.

The axe was king, and engineering feats in the mountains included lumber mills, water flumes, steam locomotives, and unrivalled will power. This grove is the largest contiguous grove in the world and contains Boole Tree, the largest sequoia on National Forest System land. This grove offers unique opportunities to study how rapidly the young sequoias grow. Unlike most of the planet&rsquo;s other species, sequoias reproduce prolifically and continue to grow rapidly well into old age. Converse Basin also offers the importance of studying historic weather patterns created from the timelines on tree rings located on the stumps.<br />Nearby Campgrounds: Princess Campground (GPS NAD 83: 36.80278, -118.93694)</p><p>In the late 1800s, the Converse Basin Grove was under private ownership, and was harvested extensively during our country&rsquo;s historic logging period. Several groups of sequoias escaped the 1880s logging. Much of the grove was cut down, denuded and the land was later sold to the U.S. Forest Service. Today, the grove has recovered and it is breathtaking!<br />Recreation Opportunities: There are quite of few areas to get out and explore!

You can visit this grove year round, but there may be snow and ice on the roads in winter so bring your tire chains. The grove is about 4,666 acres. There are several trails through this grove, including Forest Trail 31E30 and 31E31. Forest Trail 31E30 goes through the heart of the grove along the river and can be started at Belknap or Quaking Aspen campgrounds. You can stop and fish the Tule River along this trail.</p><p><strong>Nearby Campgrounds</strong>: Belknap (GPS NAD 83: 36.14167, -118.59972), Coy Flat (GPS NAD 83: 36.12917, -118.61806), Quaking Aspen (GPS NAD 83: 36.12083, -118.54722)</p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr bgcolor=\"#f7f1c2\"><td valign=\"top\" width=\"30%\"><strong>Season:</strong></td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"70%\">April through November</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"><strong>Distance:</strong></td><td valign=\"top\">1.5 miles to the junction</td></tr><tr bgcolor=\"#f7f1c2\"><td valign=\"top\"><strong>Elevation:</strong></td><td valign=\"top\">Trail head - 5,000 feet<br />Bear Ridge Junction - 6,000 feet<br />Gain - 1,000 feet</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\"><strong>Difficulty (hiking): </strong></td><td valign=\"top\">Up, Diffic",

The occasional wolverine may also be seen, as their numbers are growing within the Sawtooth Wilderness.</p><h4>Recreation:</h4><p>Several trails located within 2 miles of the cabin offer superb horseback riding opportunities, including the nearby Horse Heaven Trail. These trails are in varying stages of maintenance, but tend to be in good condition for at least 2 miles. Hikers can follow the river all the way to its headwaters in the Sawtooth Wilderness. Motorcyclists can ride the nearby roads.<br /><br />Fishing is good in the river and nearby Johnson Creek. Big game hunting is a popular activity in season.</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>",

Reaching an elevation of 10,418, the summit affords excellent views of the surrounding plateau, including the San Francisco Peaks to the east, the distant red rock of the Oak Creek/Sycamore Canyon country and Sitgreaves and Bill Williams Mountains to the south, Red Butte and distant views of the north rim of the Grand Canyon to the north. A fire lookout was first established on the summit in the early 1900&#39;s, and continues to be staffed to this day. In 2000 a majority of the wilderness was involved in a large wildfire. Dramatic vegetation patterns were created by burn intensities ranging from light to very severe, most evident on the west, north, and east slopes. On-going natural recovery processes may be observed, with early seral species becoming established in the severely burned areas. Characteristic montane coniferous forests, aspen stands, and high mountain meadow grasslands will re-establish with time. Unstable volcanic soils have undergone recurring severe erosion on the steeper slopes within burned areas, causing damage to the trails and access roads. Soils in the burn area will take many more years to re-stabilize.</p><p>Three maintained trails totaling 14 miles offer access to the wilderness, and&nbsp;lead hikers to the top of Kendrick Mountain and the fire lookout tower. When the lookout tower is open during summer months, the lookout operator usually welcomes visitors to visit the top of the tower to enjoy the views.</p><p><strong>All three trails are managed by the Kaibab National Forest.</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"/recarea/kaibab/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=11677&amp;actid=50\"><strong>Kendrick Mountain Trail</strong></a>: 9.2 miles round-trip.

Tectonic forces shifting the land to either side of the fault and subsequent erosion by Oak Creek have created a spectacular canyon where the geologic history of this area is an open book.</p><p>The Canyon is approximately 12 miles long. Oak Creek flows year-round along the bottom of the Canyon, providing water for plants and wildlife, as well as fishing and swimming opportunities. Oak Creek continues on through Sedona, Arizona, meeting up with the Verde River southeast of Cottonwood, Arizona.</p><p>The depth of the Canyon ranges from 800 to 2000 feet, with trails providing access from the Canyon&rsquo;s bottom up to the 6500-foot eastern rim and 7200-foot western rim. Some of these trails follow historic routes early Oak Creek Canyon settlers used to access the top of the plateau in the days before the road was built.

Here you can get a bird&#39;s eye view of what awaits you down the road and, at the same time, shop for Native American jewelry and other craft items from the local Native American artists who set up displays along the pathways.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve snaked your way down the switchbacks,&nbsp;SR 89A winds a lazy course down the length of Oak Creek Canyon. It&#39;s actually possible to enjoy the scenery here without leaving your car, but most people choose to get to know these crimson cliffs and crystal pools on a more personal basis. For that purpose there are plenty of overlooks, picnic areas, swimming holes and hiking trails all along the drive. At Midgely Bridge, there&#39;s a vista point with an especially unforgettable backdrop where you&#39;ll want to stop and use that wide-angle lens.</p><p>As you leave Oak Creek Canyon and continue past Sedona through Red Rock Country, an observer with a sharp eye will recognize familiar shapes among the natural sculptures that form the horizon. Keep an eye out for Steam Boat Rock, Courthouse Butte, Bell Rock and more.</p><p>You can continue down this scenic route to Interstate 17 and then back to Flagstaff, or you may want to turn around and do it all over again. If you&#39;re driving a high clearance vehicle, another way to complete the loop is to return to I-17 via the unpaved, rocky Schnebly Hill Road rather than State Route 179. The vis",

Crater Field #1 was specifically designed&nbsp;to duplicate an area within the Mare Tranquillitatis in an effort to&nbsp;train astronauts for the future Apollo mission. Craters range in diameter from 5 to 40 feet and the first phase of the field, which consisted of 47 craters, occurred July 28-31, 1967. The field was expanded in October 8-12, 1967, which added 96 craters (or 143 total). The cinder field is made up of debris that erupted from Sunset Crater in approximately 1064 A.D.</p><p>The crater fields were&nbsp;suitable for testing rover prototypes and also used to test procedures for determining location within a cratered lunar landscape. Crews tested their ability to describe crater morphologies and stratigraphic relationships in unconsolidated materials as well as how to use hand tools and test deployment methods for prototype scientific experiment packages. In order to create the crater field, crews excavated holes and filled them with dynamite (312.5 lbs) and ammonium nitrate (13,492 lbs). <a href=\"https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/rpif/videos/making-craters\" target=\"_blank\">Test explosions were used</a> to calibrate the amount of explosive needed to generate craters of specific sizes.</p><p><strong>Cinder Lake Crater Field #1</strong> was produced in two stages and was 500 x 500 feet. Part of the first stage of the field creation was designed to simulate a small area of the Apollo 11 landing site that was observed in a Lunar Orbiter image. A simulated Lunar Module was installed on a ramp within the crater field for context of where the height of the Apollo ascent windows would be. Astronauts tested mobility systems such as the &quot;Explorer&quot; vehicle and an&nbsp;experimental vehicle called &quot;Grover,&quot; which was used to training the Apollo prime and back-up crews.",
