One of Ashurst Lake&#39;s most notable characteristics is it ability to hold a high water level in drought years. That can be very important here in northern Arizona where less resilient lakes sometimes dry up.</p><p>In addition to fishing and board sailing, the lake offers excellent opportunities for birdwatching during the spring waterfowl migration. For a special treat look for white-faced ibises grazing in the shallows along with the cinnamon teal, pintails and other ducks. Bald eagles and osprey can also be seen in the area, along with a number of species of hawks and songbirds.</p><p>A graveled road to the lake and graveled road that surrounds most of the lake provides convenient access for most passenger vehicles and bicycles. Rustic gravel and &ldquo;two-track&rdquo; roads in the area offer some great opportunities to mountain bike or walk out into the surrounding juniper/ponderosa mixed forest for some wildlife viewing and open spaces. The San Francisco Peaks stand majestically on the horizon providing a grand display of Arizona&rsquo;s volcanic past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><style media=\"print\" type=\"text/css\">.noprint { display: none; }</style><div class=\"noprint\"><p style=\"clear: both; font-size: 80%;\">Hover mouse over photo to display slideshow controls. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/sets/72157686917120831\" target=\"_blank\">View album on Flicker</a></p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" data-footer=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/albums/",

Once you&#39;ve strolled beside the pleasant little stream that ripples along the canyon floor and looked up, way up, at the dizzying cliffs that tower above it, you will fall in love with it, too. West Fork is fantastic throughout the year. In springtime, migrating songbirds decorate the trees with flashes of brilliance. In autumn, the canyon is ablaze with color, with red and gold leaves floating in clear reflecting pools under a canopy of solid color. In wintertime, icicles decorate from red rock overhangs, and snatches of snow persist in cool shadows. As a matter of fact, you&#39;ll probably find a new reason to be here every time you visit.</p><p>As for the trail itself, it&#39;s an easy stroll, but you do have to cross the stream in a number of places. Usually, that involves negotiating a few strategically placed stepping stones or taking a couple of steps in shallow water. The trail is marked&nbsp;and maintained&nbsp;for the first three miles.</p><p>Many hikers explore beyond the end of the maintained trail. Eventually the pathway ends, the route becomes more strenuous,&nbsp;and you will be forced to hike in the stream bed as you continue into the <a href=\"/recarea/coconino/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=74365&amp;actid=50\"><strong>Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness</strong></a>. If you choose to travel the entire 14 mile stretch from one end of the canyon to the other, plan to do a lot of wading and boulder hopping, and even some swimming. Please read this <a href=\"/generalinfo/coconino/recreation/hiking/generalinfo/?groupid=74278&amp;recid=55432\"><strong>notice describing the strenuous 14 mile long full canyon route</strong></a> between SR 89A to FR 231 (Woody Mountain Road) before attempting this rugged wilderness route.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter how long a hike you take here, you&#39;ll enjoy it best if you come at a time when the trail is least crowded. Mornings and weekdays are best, bette",

These two trails make a scenic loop through forested canyons. Both end at the Waterline Road (FR 146) along the base of a long talus slope topped by Humphreys Peak, Arizona&#39;s highest point. The climb along either two-mile trail is steep and steady through stands of mixed conifer and aspen. The road completes the loop by connecting the top of one trail to the other, ascending 600&#39; over two miles from the top of Bear Jaw Trail to the top of Abineau Trail. From this high perspective the Grand Canyon cuts a wide gap in a the plateau stretching from the mountain to the horizon. With the almost half-mile connector trail from the trailhead to the loop (where Bear Jaw and Abineau split to follow differnt routes up the mountain), the entire hike is approximately 7 miles long.</p><p>This route passes through an area colorful at all seasons of the year. In late spring, alpine wildflowers such as lupine, rocky mountain iris, penstemon and paintbrush splash the trailside meadows. Sunflowers add yellow in summer, and groves of aspen paint the slopes with crimson and gold during the fall.</p><p>You may spot a black bear here&mdash;perhaps the best chance you&#39;ll have around the Peaks. These big shy animals occasionally show themselves along these trails. Mule deer and elk are also plentiful. Common birds include juncos, Steller&#39;s jays and Clark&#39;s nutcrackers. In spring and early summer the melodious hermit thrush will serenade you.</p><p>Early in 2005, a huge avalanche did extensive damage to the trail in Abineau Canyon. Although the trail reopened by that summer, evidence of the avalanche still remains in toppled trees and gouged rock.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" data-footer=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/albums/72157657322858164\" title=\"Trails: Abineau-Bear Jaw Loop\"><img alt=\"Trails: Abineau-Bear J",

That river of liquid rock, now frozen forever, is just one of the many remnants of volcanic activity which lend an otherwordly appearance to this starkly beautiful place. Though the cinder cones, lava squeeze-ups, lava caves, and petrified rock bubbles that dot the landscape became inactive over a century ago, they all look as if they could have been spurting and spouting just yesterday. This area of recent volcanic activity is so unique that much of it has been set aside as the Sunset Crater National Monument. The monument is located just beyond the boundaries of the campground.</p><p>Also nearby is Wupatki National Monument. The centerpiece of this area is a four story masterpiece of Native American stone masonry. Construction of that stone-age condominium began in about A. D. 1120. At one time it contained as many as 100 rooms and housed as many as 125 people. Both Sunset Crater and Wupatki have visitor centers and feature self-guided as well as interpreter guided tours.</p><p>The campsites are located in a stand of ponderosa pines struggling to establish a foothold in this hostile environment.

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>Kendrick Mountain Wilderness encompasses Kendrick Peak, one of the many peaks of the vast San Francisco mountain volcanic field located on the Coconino Plateau in north-central Arizona. Reaching an elevation of 10,418, the summit affords excellent views of the surrounding plateau, including the San Francisco Peaks to the east, the distant red rock of the Oak Creek/Sycamore Canyon country and Sitgreaves and Bill Williams Mountains to the south, Red Butte and distant views of the north rim of the Grand Canyon to the north. A fire lookout was first established on the summit in the early 1900&#39;s, and continues to be staffed to this day. In 2000 a majority of the wilderness was involved in a large wildfire. Dramatic vegetation patterns were created by burn intensities ranging from light to very severe, most evident on the west, north, and east slopes. On-going natural recovery processes may be observed, with early seral species becoming established in the severely burned areas. Characteristic montane coniferous forests, aspen stands, and high mountain meadow grasslands will re-establish with time. Unstable volcanic soils have undergone recurring severe erosion on the steeper slopes within burned areas, causing damage to the trails and access roads. Soils in the burn area will take many more years to re-stabilize.</p><p>Three maintained trails totaling 14 miles offer access to the wilderness, and&nbsp;lead hikers to the top of Kendrick Mountain and the fire lookout tower. When the lookout tower is open during summer months, the lookout operator usually welcomes visitors to visit the top of the tower to enjoy the views.</p><p><strong>All three trails are managed by the Kaibab National Forest.</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"/recarea/kaibab/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=11677&amp;actid=50\"><strong>Kendrick Mountain Trail</strong></a>: 9.2 miles round-trip.

Since 1978, professional archaeologists have supervised members of the public in excavations, archaeological research techniques and artifact analysis through a variety of public and school programs.</p><p>Conveniently located on U.S. Highway 89 north, Elden Pueblo is thought to have been part of a major trading system. This is evidenced by discoveries of trade items, such as macaw skeletons from as far south as Mexico, to shell jewelry from the California Coast. Important discoveries recently uncovered at Elden Pueblo suggest that the Sunset Crater volcano may have erupted over a much longer period of time than previously thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\"Elden Pueblo Photos\" src=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5341799.jpg\" style=\"height: 111px; width: 510px\" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Arizona Natural History Association sponsors the Elden Pueblo Archaeology Project with the Coconino National Forest to provide opportunities for people to learn about and become involved in the science of archaeology.

The August Public Day features a Primitive Technology Expo and the last Public Day of the year takes place in the fall as part of the annual Flagstaff Festival of Science.</p><p>Elden Pueblo is available for school programs and groups of up to thirty people.

When the lake has water, its banks are usually lined with anglers trying to catch the trout which the Arizona Game and Fish Department stocks here.

Small wave-like undulations in the floor are the remains of ripples frozen in the last trickle of molten rock that flowed from the cave. Stone icicles hanging from the ceiling show where a final blast of volcanic heat caused the rock to partially re-liquefy and drip.</p><p>Dress appropriately when you come to visit, with warm clothes and sturdy shoes. The cave is as cool as 42&deg; even in summer, and you may even find some ice inside. The rocks are always sharp and slippery, too. Bring two or three sources of light, in case one happens to fail, it can be very dark one mile from the nearest light source.</p><p>Portions of the cave which were once defaced by graffiti&nbsp;have been cleaned up.

This is a terrific campground for those who cherish a real mountain camping experience and love to hike wilderness trails. You may catch a glimpse of the natural residents, porcupine or elk or thrill to the song of a hermit thrush that sings his best here. Even black bear have been known to stroll right through groups of picnickers without as much as a glance at their lunches.</p><p>The San Francisco Peaks are actually the remains of an extinct volcano, which mllions of years ago shattered and reshaped these great peaks, forming four of the highest individual peaks in Arizona and is home to the only region of tundra in Arizona. Inside the now quiet caldera a lush alpine environment has blurred evidence of that cataclysmic event.</p><p>The <strong><a href=\"/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55110\">Inner Basin Trail</a></strong> that leads into the heart of the ancient volcano begins in beautiful Lockett Meadow. Starting at this island of emerald, which is ringed with quaking aspen stands and majestic high peaks, it leads into the mountain&rsquo;s now quiet Inner Basin. The spring and summer wild flowers add a sprinkling of blue, red and yellow to the peaceful scene. While fall turns the extensive stands of aspen, which cover the steep slopes of the caldera, to solid gold, Winter avalanche tracks streak down the talus slopes exposing remnants of old lava flows which bear witness to the mountain&rsquo;s turbulent heritage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><style media=\"print\" type=\"text/css\">.noprint { display: none; }</style><div class=\"noprint\"><p style=\"clear: both; font-size: 80%;\">Hover mouse over photo to display slideshow controls. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/sets/72157659237579745\" target=\"_blank\">View album on Flicker</a></p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" data-footer=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/albums/721576592375",

Sunset Crater and Wupatki National Monuments have visitor centers and feature self-guided and interpreter guided tours.</p><p>Another popular activity is to hike up <a href=\"/recarea/coconino/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=55146&amp;actid=50\"><strong>O&#39;Leary Peak Trail</strong></a> to the O&rsquo;Leary Lookout Tower where the Forest Service spots wildfires.

Cinder cones and lava flows dot the landscape. Hardy desert plants stand in sharp contrast to the dark volcanic soils in which they struggle for survival.

Sunset Crater features a self-guided nature walk through an extensive lava field and interpretive displays on volcanic activity. The centerpiece of Wupatki National Monument is a four story stone apartment house created around 900 years ago.

The creek is regularly stocked with trout. Colorful songbirds add a flash of brilliance to the trees. Access is easy. The campground is just a few yards off US 89A and the pull-throughs are paved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><style media=\"print\" type=\"text/css\">.noprint { display: none; }</style><div class=\"noprint\"><p style=\"clear: both; font-size: 80%;\">Hover mouse over photo to display slideshow controls. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/sets/72157688952536044\" target=\"_blank\">View album on Flicker</a></p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" data-footer=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/albums/72157688952536044\" title=\"Camping: Manzanita Campground\"><img alt=\"Camping: Manzanita Campground\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4567/37514240304_1a744f1fce_z.jpg\" style=\"width: 98%; height: auto;\" /></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</p>",

Crater Field #1 was specifically designed&nbsp;to duplicate an area within the Mare Tranquillitatis in an effort to&nbsp;train astronauts for the future Apollo mission. Craters range in diameter from 5 to 40 feet and the first phase of the field, which consisted of 47 craters, occurred July 28-31, 1967. The field was expanded in October 8-12, 1967, which added 96 craters (or 143 total). The cinder field is made up of debris that erupted from Sunset Crater in approximately 1064 A.D.</p><p>The crater fields were&nbsp;suitable for testing rover prototypes and also used to test procedures for determining location within a cratered lunar landscape. Crews tested their ability to describe crater morphologies and stratigraphic relationships in unconsolidated materials as well as how to use hand tools and test deployment methods for prototype scientific experiment packages. In order to create the crater field, crews excavated holes and filled them with dynamite (312.5 lbs) and ammonium nitrate (13,492 lbs). <a href=\"https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/rpif/videos/making-craters\" target=\"_blank\">Test explosions were used</a> to calibrate the amount of explosive needed to generate craters of specific sizes.</p><p><strong>Cinder Lake Crater Field #1</strong> was produced in two stages and was 500 x 500 feet. Part of the first stage of the field creation was designed to simulate a small area of the Apollo 11 landing site that was observed in a Lunar Orbiter image. A simulated Lunar Module was installed on a ramp within the crater field for context of where the height of the Apollo ascent windows would be. Astronauts tested mobility systems such as the &quot;Explorer&quot; vehicle and an&nbsp;experimental vehicle called &quot;Grover,&quot; which was used to training the Apollo prime and back-up crews.",

It was originally a guard station, used by fire watchers in the forest. It is situated on the East Fork of Bitterroot River, at an elevation of about 4,500 feet. &nbsp;The river flows west from within the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness, to just south of Conner, Montana, where it joins the West Fork of the Bitterroot River to form the Bitterroot River. During the spring the river becomes a dangerous combination of fast water and snags.&nbsp;The Anacondas are home to abundant wildlife, including mountain lions, elk, deer, moose and bears (learn about outdoor safety).</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Fishing is popular in the nearby river. A variety of trout, including brown, rainbow, cutthroat and brook, can be found in the area between Sula and Conner. Winter fishing for whitefish is popular and productive, as the river is closed to trout fishing during the colder months. The catch along the East Fork is fairly evenly divided between bait, spin and fly fishermen.&nbsp;The surrounding hills and valleys are popular for hiking, backpacking and horseback riding in the summer and fall.

Together with lush meadow and shrub-steppe uplands, these habitats support a diversity of wildlife seldom found in the high desert and is one of the most important waterfowl nesting areas in the region. The refuge is either home or a stopover location for over 220 species of birds. Of specific interest are canvasback ducks, trumpeter swans, greater sandhill cranes and sage grouse. Mule deer and pronghorn antelope can also be found in the area.</p><p>Ruby Lake is visible from the campground and offers excellent birding, fishing and hiking. The lake is stocked with largemouth bass and several species of trout. The Ruby Lake NWR headquarters is 2 miles north of the campground and offers visitor information.</p><p>The campground is located on the Hastings Cutoff route, near the Pony Express Trail and historic ruins of Fort Ruby. A new interpretive trail was recently constructed at the Fort Ruby historic site and provides insight on local history as well as spectacular views of the southern Ruby Mountains and beyond, all relatively uninterrupted by human development. The southern trailhead for the Ruby Crest National Recreation Trail at Green Mountain is located within a reasonable driving distance from the campground. Many dirt and gravel roads begin at Harrison Pass (just north of the refuge) and Overland Pass (south of the area) and provide enjoyable routes for jeeps, off road motorcycles, OHVs, and mountain bikes.</p><p>A forest of pinyon pine and juniper covers the area offering partial shade. The campground contains 33 single sites, 1 double and 1 handicap site with picnic tables and campfire rings. Vault toilets, drinking water and trash collection are provided during the main summer season,",

Furniture construction was done by the USDA - Forest Service. Tom&#39;s Lake is 23 acre lake located in the heart of the Hiawatha National Forest approximately 29 miles northwest of Manistique in Schoolcraft County. The lake is 1/4 mile north of County Road 440, off Forest Road 2082. The cabin itself is situated on a small knoll on a large semi-open area surrounded by tall pines. The cabin is one-quarter mile west of the Ironjaw semi-primitive area and the Pine Marten Run trail system, which offers 26 miles of trail suitable for horseback riders, mountain bikers and hikers. The cabin is also within a short commute of the Big Island Lake Wilderness with its 23 small lakes and portages to challenge the canoeist. The nationally-designated Wild and Scenic Indian River is also nearby, and its 51 miles offer outstanding canoeing and fishing opportunities. For the winter enthusiast, snowmobile trails can be found nearby, and the Pine Marten Run trail is frequently used for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing (although the trail is not groomed). There are a wide variety of year-round recreational experiences available in the area! There is a good swimming area at Tom&#39;s Lake, however the site has not been checked for possible hazards so caution should be exercised. Please remember that you swim at your own risk. Boat access to the lake is limited to carry-in only. There are private cabins on the other side of the lake, and you may see or hear motorized boats and jet skis that access Tom&#39;s Lake from their properties. Tom&#39;s Lake was surveyed by fisheries biologists in 1996. That inventory found a decent large mouth bass and bluegill fishery.</p>",

The Iroquois had invaded the area in an attempt to gain influence and dominate the fur trade, but the Ojibwa were able to defeat the Iroquois war party, thus halting their westward expansion. According to the Indian agent of scholar, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, the Ojibwa called Point Iroquois &quot; Nau-do-we-e-gun-ing&quot;, which in their native language means &quot;Place of Iroquois Bones.&quot;</p><p>In 1620, the first white men to the area were French explorers Brule and Grenoble. From that time, Point Iroquois became a familiar landmark for the French explorers, fur traders and the missionaries who were to follow. Sault Ste. Marie was the first white settlement in what was later to become Michigan.</p><p>The discovery of copper and iron ore in 1844 necessitated a passage for ore-carrying vessels through the rapids of St. Mary&#39;s River to the steel plants of the lower Great Lakes. In 1865, the St. Mary&#39;s Falls Canal (commonly known as the Soo Locks) was opened. The locks have since become the most heavily used commercial shipping canal in the world.</p><p>The first lighthouse and lightkeepers residence were built in 1855, and the light was exhibited for the first time on September 20, 1857.

The pines, spruce, hemlock and cedar provide the greens and the lakes provide different hues of blue.</p><p>Hike the many trails or drive the network of roads throughout the forest.

A light or set of lights was needed to allow vessels to use Munising Harbor as a major harbor of refuge. The Lighthouse Board spent the funds in 1868-70 building the East Channel Light and a pair of range lights on shore. The lighthouse, a wood framed keeper&#39;s house with an attached square wooden tower operated only until 1913 when it was replaced by the new range lights installed at Munising in 1908. George Prior was working as keeper at the East Channel Light at the turn of the century and was probably the last person to serve at the post.</p><p>The Grand Island East Channel Lighthouse is on the southeast shore of Grand Island. You can see it from the decks of a Pictured Rocks or Alger underwater preserve cruise boat as it heads from Munising Harbor to the national lakeshore area, or from a private boat. Though Grand Island is a designated National Recreation Area and is now much more accessible to the public, <strong>the lighthouse itself remains on private property.</strong></p><p>Long abandoned, the lighthouse was in danger of crumbling to the ground until just a few years ago, when a group of private citizens, including the owner, decided to do something about it. They repaired its stone foundation and supported the tower and house with a series of cables. Now a much sturdier building rests on the sandy shoreline of the island.</p><p>Its deep brown foundation shows signs of the repairs, but its wood siding has not seen a trace of paint or other decoration. The wood has weathered to a dark gray and the square tower is capped with a dome of green copper roofing and exposed to the eleme",

Frank originally came to the Straits area to help build the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island. It was commissioned on May 15, 1896 under the U.S. Lighthouse Board which became the United States Lighthouse Service in 1910. In 1924 the beacon was automated and the United States Coast Guard was given responsibility for all lighthouses in 1939. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1947, and transferred to the United States Forest Service in 1958. The beacon has gone through several changes of lighting technology, from oil to electricity. It originally had a 4th order Fresnel lens with a steady white light followed by a red flash every 20 seconds. Today it is powered by the sun using solar cells and storage batteries. On the first floor, most of the original machinery for operation of the lighthouse and foghorn were removed for scrap to support World War II efforts. The second and third floors provided living quarters for the lighthouse keepers and their families during the shipping season.</p><p>The Forest Service has a unique partnership to assist with maintenance and upkeep of the lighthouse and out buildings.&nbsp; The Round Island Lighthouse Preservation Society is a Michigan non-profit corporation, founded solely to assist with facilitating the preservation of the Round Island Lighthouse and grounds.&nbsp; In addition, the Lake Huron Area Council Boy Scout Troop 323 of Freeland, Michigan also assists with summer clean-up activities and repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about the Round Island Lighthouse, please call the S",

It was               natural that much of the CCC work centered on National Forests               like that of the Hiawatha. On the Manistique R. D. (which in 1935               covered 333,000 acres) are a number of CCC sites, including camps,               work projects and plantations.</p>",

While it lacks the size of the Grand Canyon, it certainly measures up in terms of outstanding, rugged geology and sheer scenic beauty. It is one of a few rivers to flow through the saguaro cactus forests of the Sonoran Desert, a truly exotic landscape.</p><p>A Tonto National Forest Upper Salt River boater permit is required to float the Salt River Canyon Wilderness from March 1st to May 15th annually. The Upper Salt River is a solid Class III-IV river and requires whitewater boating skills. As the water level drops the river becomes more technically difficult, and at low water a few of the rapids approach Class V. Because it is a free flowing river, it also has the potential to go to flood stage and become very dangerous in just hours.</p><p>The weather varies greatly in the Sonoran Desert, and it is not uncommon to find yourself wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and later wearing your winter weather gear. It is a good idea to&nbsp;check the weather&nbsp;before you leave for your trip, as there is no cell phone service in the canyon.&nbsp;Water levels&nbsp;vary from year to year, so it is wise to check on the&nbsp;snow pack&nbsp;in Arizona&#39;s White Mountains.</p><p>You must launch on your permitted day. Typically boaters launch on river right from First Campground on Apache Road 1 just down from where the Highway 60 Bridge crosses the Upper Salt River. The take-out for the permitted wilderness section is just downstream of the Highway 288 Bridge on river left, 52.3 miles downstream from First Campground. Most people with boater permits plan a four or five day river trip.</p><p>There are no trails in the Salt River Canyon Wilderness, but many of the side canyons are great hikes. The wildflowers in the Sonoran Desert can be magical in the spring, and just walking out into the desert from any of the camps can lead to fabulous scenic hiking.</p><p>There are several grocery stores in Globe, the ",

During the 1860&#39;s, the ports of Escanaba, Gladstone, Fayette and Nahma were teeming with ships hauling fish, lumber, iron ore and other products. These sailing ships needed navigational help to protect their hulls. When iron ore loading docks were built in Escanaba in 1864, Congress appropriated the funds to build a lighthouse. Construction of the lighthouse in 1865, included a 1&frac12; story brick home for the keeper and his family. A hand-operated oil lamp burned in the lighthouse until 1922, when an automated acetylene light replaced it. The lighthouse keeper, Captain James Armstrong was transferred to the Escanaba light station. In 1936, when the Minneapolis shoal lighthouse was put into operation, Peninsula Point light was snuffed out and the property declared surplus. In 1937, the FS was granted custodianship of Peninsula Point Lighthouse. The Civilian Conservation Corps repaired the buildings and constructed picnic grounds. However, the remote unoccupied station became a target for vandals and in 1948, when the FS could no longer finance repairs, demolition of the lighthouse was considered. The Stonington Grange agreed to take over maintenance, and their rehabilitation work earned them first prize in the 1949 statewide Grange Community Service contest. The lighthouse keeper&rsquo;s quarters burned in 1959, but the brick tower survived and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today visitors can climb the 40 foot circular staircase to find a panoramic view of Lake Michigan. Rest rooms, as well as tables and grills for picnics, are available. The limestone shoreline yields fossils estimated at 400-500 million years old. And Peninsula Point is also a popular spot to enjoy the Monarch Butterfly and bird mi",

The unique landscape was created by extreme erosion and faulting that has sculpted spectacular canyons and buttes. The rim serves as the geographical dividing line between the cool high country above and the hot, dry desert below. Christopher Creek is located in the desert portion, but is balanced by the cool waters of the creek and forested surroundings.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>Christopher Creek provides creek side dwelling in Tonto National Forest, at the base of the Mogollon Rim. Sites are surrounded by ponderosa pines, junipers, oaks and manzanita evergreen shrubs.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:&nbsp;After a day of horseback riding or mountain biking, take a dip in one of the facility&#39;s three swimming holes to cool off from the summer sun. Or if winter is more your thing, visit during the snowy months to take advantage of the miles of cross-country skiing available. Each spring, the creek is stocked with rainbow trout, allowing anglers the opportunity to cast their hearts out for rainbows as well as brook and brown trout.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: The family-friendly campground has 43 sites on both sides of the creek, plus a group site that accommodates a maximum of 25 people.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions:&nbsp;</strong>The small town of Christopher Creek is just a short drive away and offers a few restaurant options for those who tire of cooking",

Its boundaries are Phoenix to the south, the Mogollon Rim to the north and the San Carlos and Fort Apache Indian reservations to the east.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>The ponderosa pine trees make this a memorable campground. Larger ponderosas release a vanilla scent into the air and have a relatively open understory, making the area perfect for camping. Mixed into the understory are junipers, oaks and manzanita shrubs.&nbsp;The campground sits on the border of the Mogollon Rim, pronounced by locals as &quot;muggy-own,&quot; a 200-mile-long cliff in northern Arizona that ranges between 5,000 and 7,000 feet in elevation. The unique landscape was created by extreme erosion and faulting that has sculpted spectacular canyons and buttes. The rim serves as the geographical dividing line between the cool high country above and the hot, dry desert below.</p><p><strong>Recreation:&nbsp;</strong>Most visitors enjoy walking along the campground&#39;s nature trail, traveling into the town of Payson, taking advantage of the area&#39;s hiking trails and lakes or simply relaxing at the campsite.&nbsp;Scenic driving and outdoor recreation abound in the surrounding Tonto National Forest. A series of lakes called the Rim Country Lakes are about a 15 minute drive east. Woods Canyon Lake is one of the most popular recreational lakes in the state and offers options for boating.</p><p><strong>Facilities:&nbsp;</strong>The facility provides 48 single campsites and two group sites that can accommodate up to 50 people guests ea",

The Verde River flows through this entire district; Horseshoe and Bartlett Reservoirs are located here.</p><p>Watershed protection was one of the most important reasons that the Tonto National Forest was established. Since then, the Salt and Verde rivers have had six dams constructed. While the dammed water is of great value for irrigating fields and for domestic use, it is also very popular with thousands of people who recreate in its waters every year.</p><p>Water recreation ranges from the simple to the sophisticated. Some activities require highly mechanized equipment, while other popular activities only require a swimming suit.

The two lakes are divided by a narrow channel.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: A local beach is easily accessible, where swimming and boating are available.&nbsp;Visitors enjoy kayaking, canoeing or power boating up a 2.5-mile channel called Thoroughfare that leads to the Upper Priest Lake Scenic Area, where birding is a popular activity.&nbsp;Beaver Creek has two trailheads, one for the 9-mile Navigation Trail that heads north, and one for the 8-mile Lakeshore Trail that heads south. Both trails offer sweeping mountain views and are enjoyed by both hikers and horseback riders.&nbsp;Anglers find an abundance of trout fishing in Beaver Creek and in Upper and Lower Priest Lake.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Beaver Creek offers approximately 42 spacious, reservable campsites, including one large group site that can accommodate up to 35 guests. Amenities include drinking water, vault toilets and picnic tables. A boat ramp is just outside the campground entrance for boats 20 feet long or shorter.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions: </strong>Cross country skiing and snow shoeing are excellent in the Kaniksu Forest Region of Priest Lake.</p>",
