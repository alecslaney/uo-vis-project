                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>There are a number of reasons why West Fork is one of the most popular trails on the Coconino National Forest. Once you&#39;ve strolled beside the pleasant little stream that ripples along the canyon floor and looked up, way up, at the dizzying cliffs that tower above it, you will fall in love with it, too. West Fork is fantastic throughout the year. In springtime, migrating songbirds decorate the trees with flashes of brilliance. In autumn, the canyon is ablaze with color, with red and gold leaves floating in clear reflecting pools under a canopy of solid color. In wintertime, icicles decorate from red rock overhangs, and snatches of snow persist in cool shadows. As a matter of fact, you&#39;ll probably find a new reason to be here every time you visit.</p><p>As for the trail itself, it&#39;s an easy stroll, but you do have to cross the stream in a number of places. Usually, that involves negotiating a few strategically placed stepping stones or taking a couple of steps in shallow water. The trail is marked&nbsp;and maintained&nbsp;for the first three miles.</p><p>Many hikers explore beyond the end of the maintained trail. Eventually the pathway ends, the route becomes more strenuous,&nbsp;and you will be forced to hike in the stream bed as you continue into the <a href=\"/recarea/coconino/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=74365&amp;actid=50\"><strong>Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness</strong></a>. If you choose to travel the entire 14 mile stretch from one end of the canyon to the other, plan to do a lot of wading and boulder hopping, and even some swimming. Please read this <a href=\"/generalinfo/coconino/recreation/hiking/generalinfo/?groupid=74278&amp;recid=55432\"><strong>notice describing the strenuous 14 mile long full canyon route</strong></a> between SR 89A to FR 231 (Woody Mountain Road) before attempting this rugged wilderness route.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter how long a hike you take here, you&#39;ll enjoy it best if you come at a time when the trail is least crowded.

Hiking, sightseeing, wildlife watching and skiing are the predominant recreation activities enjoyed in this land of mountains, forests and lava flows.</p><p>Flagstaff Ranger District, extends from north of the Peaks to the south. This rolling highland is a land of ponderosa pine forests and pinyon/juniper woodlands clustered around broad prairies and small lakes. Arizona&#39;s largest natural lake, Mormon Lake, is located here. The area is also known for its plentiful wildlife. Large herds of elk roam the forests and edgelands. Bald eagles and ospreys live and hunt around the lakes. Pronghorn antelope graze the prairies.</p><p>Principal recreation activities among the lakes and prairies are boating, fishing, camping, and wildlife watching.

The exterior of the furnace was manufactured of large limestone blocks quarried near the town of Cave-In-Rock. The interior wall, or lining, was constructed of firebrick from Pennsylvania. The space between the interior and exterior walls was filled with sandstone. Wrought iron binders were placed through the stonework and tightened to secure the walls. All of the stonework was dry laid. A 1/2 mile trail leading from the back of the picnic area features bottomland habitat and bottomland tree species. The trail winds along Big Creek and offers 2 or 3 deep old-fashioned fishing holes. Once a site of an iron making blast furnace, the picnic area contains a reconstructed blast furnace as a monument to our nation&#39;s past industry.</p>",

                "RECAREADESCRIPTION": "<p>From the Abineau (#127) and Bear Jaw (#26) trails, on the north slope of the San Francisco Peaks, you can see the Grand Canyon seventy miles away. These two trails make a scenic loop through forested canyons. Both end at the Waterline Road (FR 146) along the base of a long talus slope topped by Humphreys Peak, Arizona&#39;s highest point. The climb along either two-mile trail is steep and steady through stands of mixed conifer and aspen. The road completes the loop by connecting the top of one trail to the other, ascending 600&#39; over two miles from the top of Bear Jaw Trail to the top of Abineau Trail. From this high perspective the Grand Canyon cuts a wide gap in a the plateau stretching from the mountain to the horizon. With the almost half-mile connector trail from the trailhead to the loop (where Bear Jaw and Abineau split to follow differnt routes up the mountain), the entire hike is approximately 7 miles long.</p><p>This route passes through an area colorful at all seasons of the year. In late spring, alpine wildflowers such as lupine, rocky mountain iris, penstemon and paintbrush splash the trailside meadows. Sunflowers add yellow in summer, and groves of aspen paint the slopes with crimson and gold during the fall.</p><p>You may spot a black bear here&mdash;perhaps the best chance you&#39;ll have around the Peaks. These big shy animals occasionally show themselves along these trails. Mule deer and elk are also plentiful. Common birds include juncos, Steller&#39;s jays and Clark&#39;s nutcrackers. In spring and early summer the melodious hermit thrush will serenade you.</p><p>Early in 2005, a huge avalanche did extensive damage to the trail in Abineau Canyon. Although the trail reopened by that summer, evidence of the avalanche still remains in toppled trees and gouged rock.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" data-footer=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/coconinonationalforest/albums/72157657322858164\" title=\"Trails: Abineau-Bear Jaw Loop\"><img alt=\"Trails: Abineau-Bear J",

Though the cinder cones, lava squeeze-ups, lava caves, and petrified rock bubbles that dot the landscape became inactive over a century ago, they all look as if they could have been spurting and spouting just yesterday. This area of recent volcanic activity is so unique that much of it has been set aside as the Sunset Crater National Monument. The monument is located just beyond the boundaries of the campground.</p><p>Also nearby is Wupatki National Monument. The centerpiece of this area is a four story masterpiece of Native American stone masonry. Construction of that stone-age condominium began in about A. D. 1120. At one time it contained as many as 100 rooms and housed as many as 125 people.

The majority of the climbing is characterized by steep highly pocketed limestone/sandstone mix cliffs. Route length varies from short &ldquo;bouldery&rdquo; twenty foot routes to long &ldquo;pumpy&rdquo; routes around seventy feet. On vertical walls, the rock can be bubbly with edges and blocks. If you want to find fun and safe sport climbing on the Coconino National Forest, this is your place. Sport climbing, focused on movement and safety offers the opportunity for large dynamic moves on well protected routes. Fixed anchoring systems here keep climbers safe while minimizing impact to the rock compared to traditional anchoring systems such as pitons and trees. Jacks Canyon boasts 300 routes of what some consider being some of the best sport climbing in the country. Jacks Canyon is a great collaboration between the National Forest and the rapidly growing user group of rock climbers.</p><p>The roll-over photos here are from the top of the rim overlooking climbing areas and at the bottom at the creek.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Camping</strong>: The camping is free and unimproved at the canyon rim, where a 10 minute trail gets you to the routes.

Not only will you be helping your chances by changing location, but each of these bodies of water is known for producing a different species of fish. The three shallow lakes in this group serve forest visitors as places to set up a primitive camp and go fishing. <strong>Soldier Lake</strong> provides good fishing for bass and catfish. <strong>Soldier Annex Lake</strong> is better known for its catfish, although blue gill can also be caught here. <strong>Long Lake</strong> is the only one of the three that is stocked with trout but is also good for walleye and catfish.</p><p>Many forest visitors come here to set up primitive camps and enjoy other forest activities besides fishing, such as off highway vehicle riding and wildlife watching. The lakes are located in an area of open grasslands dotted with pinyon and juniper trees.</p><p><strong>Campground Season</strong>: There are no developed campgrounds at these lakes. The nearest developed campground is Blue Ridge Campground which is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day.</p><p><strong>Attractions</strong>: Boating/canoeing, fishing, wildlife watching</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: Valut-type toilets and two boat ramps at Long Lake.</p><p><strong>Helpful Links from the <a href=\"http://www.azgfd.gov/\">Arizona Game &amp; Fish Department</a>: </strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://boat-ed.com/az/handbook/\">Handbook of Boating Laws and Responsibilities</a> - the official Arizona boating handbook</li><li><a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaw",

A graveled road to the lake and around it provides a good place to ride your mountain bike. The setting&#39;s not bad either. The San Francisco Peaks stand picture perfect on the horizon.</p><p>Ashurst Lake is medium-sized, as northern Arizona lakes go, but it has a reputation for holding water even through long dry spells.

At the turn of the century, the industry developed in the Hanging Rock Iron Region of Ohio and Kentucky which became the largest iron producer in the US.</p><p>The Hanging Rock region produced iron from 1818 to 1916 and was one of three in the country capable of producing the iron needed during the Civil War. Not long after the war, the iron boom in Hanging Rock ceased. Hanging Rock&rsquo;s Vesuvius Furnace, located on today&rsquo;s Wayne National Forest, is a remnant of 1 of the 46 furnaces in the region.</p><p>The iron boom brought in workers who often lived in company towns. Company towns compensated workers with company &ldquo;money&rdquo; that could be used only within the town. Ironmasters owned the furnaces and managed company towns.</p><p>Ironmasters tended to be abolitionists and often provided support to the Underground Railroad as conductors or station masters. Furnaces and the connecting company towns provided safe havens and financial aid for freedom seekers. Several of the routes used by individuals escaping slavery were along the same paths of Ohio&rsquo;s iron furnaces.</p><p>Black Fork settlement, an iron company town located in Lawrence County, Ohio, employed mostly African Americans, some escaped slaves.

The State of Illinois required a $1,000 bond for any free person of color to enter.</p><p>Freedom seekers saved or collected money for the bonds, but often still needed help. Henry Sides provided such help and served as the liaison and mediator between the courts and the freed individuals. He became a vital link between the African Americans and the community of Miller Grove and Pope County.</p><p>Henry Sides and his wife, Barbara, arrived to Miller Grove alongside the original four migrant families. Sides was a white former slaveholder in Tennessee, but when he left the state he manumitted all of his slaves and posted their bonds to enter Illinois. True to his Presbyterian and political beliefs, Sides worked and lived side by side with free Blacks in the community.</p><p>Despite being beaten and robbed (likely because of the bond money they held) Henry and Barbara continued to contribute substantial sums of money to post bonds for incoming African Americans.

With the help of Henry Sides, a fellow former slave holder, Joseph purchased the $1,000 bonds to bring each of his manumitted slaves to Illinois as free men, women, and children.</p><p>Edward (Ned) Dabbs was one of Joseph&rsquo;s manumitted slaves (it was common for free Blacks to keep the names of their former white slave families). Ned married Dolly Sides in April, 1848, and the couple continued to live in the community. Unlike a majority of the adults at Miller Grove, Ned was literate. The community cherished his skills and his service as a reader and disseminator of information throughout the settlement.</p><p>Ned also became involved in the abolitionist movement with the American Missionary Association (AMA). In 1864, he submitted a handwritten request for AMA&rsquo;s antislavery literature. The literature, along with letters left by James West, imply that members of the community - possibly including Ned himself - were active in the Underground Railroad.</p><p>Joseph Dabbs left one-third of his estate to Ned in his will. When Ned died in 1866, his personal effects included a large collection of books and farm animals. However, Ned acquired these belongings himself - they were not inherited from Dabbs - and attest to the life he lived after gaining his freedom.</p><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Cheryl LaRoche, <em>Free Black Communities and the Underground Railroad: the Geography of Resistance</em></p><p>Vickie Devenport and Mary R.

Among its founding members included those who aided in the defense of the Amistad captives in 1839. The AMA helped put the abolishment of slavery onto the national political agenda.</p><p>Although it was a national association, the AMA focused its financial and other resources to help Border States (where free and slave states adjoined) operate the Underground Railroad. The region of southern Illinois, including today&rsquo;s Shawnee National Forest, proved vital to their cause and became a focal point. The letters of James West, an AMA preacher, confirm that Pope County and Miller Grove were a hotbed of anti-slavery activity.</p><p>Over 300 missionaries, called &ldquo;colporteurs,&rdquo; were stationed throughout southern Illinois which they referred to as &ldquo;Egypt.&rdquo; They arrived there with aspirations of changing the hearts and minds of local citizens by preaching and passing out Bibles. They also distributed antislavery literature including their own magazine, the American Missionary, published from 1846 through 1934.</p><p>Literacy and education was a focus of the AMA. They believed that the anti-literacy laws perpetuated slavery by enslaving minds as well as bodies. During the Civil War the AMA began to build schools for freedmen. By 1866, they had chartered seven higher education institutions for African Americans and helped in the establishment of Howard University.</p><p>In 1934, the Board of Homeland Ministries absorbed the AMA. It was taken over by the by the United Church Board of Homeland Ministries in 1987.</p><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp; </strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>Cheryl LaRoche, <em>Free Black Communities and the Underground Railroad: the Geography of Resistance </em><o:p></o:p></p><p>Vickie Devenport and Mary R.

West resided about three miles south of Miller Grove and much of what is speculated about the community&rsquo;s involvement in the Underground Railroad comes from a collection of West&rsquo;s letters. The letters are mostly correspondence between himself and members of the American Missionary Association (AMA).</p><p>James West was a strident abolitionist and a preacher for the AMA. Along with passing out bibles and antislavery literature, he preached antislavery ideology. He was not na&iuml;ve about his work - his father, a Methodist preacher who laid the foundation for James&rsquo;s antislavery fervor, had been killed because of his views. Originally from Kentucky, West eventually moved his wife, Sarah, and their children north to Illinois after he was persecuted and abused in his hometown.</p><p>In October 1856, the family settled in Pope County, Illinois, where West taught school for a short time. In a letter to the AMA, he recognized the irony of being the only radical abolitionist teacher employed in the region that, although a Free State, held vehement hostility toward African Americans. Despite these hostilities, West continued to preach throughout the county for people to reject slavery and accept Free Blacks into their communities. His letters to the AMA board members mentions his &ldquo;friends&rdquo; in the region which most likely refers to the African American community at Miller Grove.</p><p>Although mentioning specific information about the Underground Railroad could have jeopardized the operation, his letters discuss the region as a good &ldquo;second depot&rdquo; and &ldquo;railroad.&rdquo; In his letters with Brother Jocelyn of AMA, he explains that the proximity to the river was ideal and requested additional resources and AMA members to help.</p><p>In 1860, James reported to AMA that &ldquo;colporteurs&rdquo; (someone who distributes religious or similar literatur",

Harrison Miller - the founder and patriarch of the town - brought his wife Lucinda and their three children from a Tennessee plantation to the woodlands of Pope County.</p><p>Although Harrison and his immediate family could not read nor write, education was important to him and the community of Miller Grove. Harrison served as an executor for a nearby former slave owner&rsquo;s estate; later he became the owner and the land was used for the Mt. Gilead African Methodist Episcopal Church as well as a school. Sadly, the original log church burnt down in 1918.</p><p>In 1860, the census showed Julia Singleton as a Black schoolteacher. Julia was a freed African American from Peter Singleton, one of the four original Miller Grove families. Archeologists recently found writing slates at Miller-connected sites.</p><p>Harrison and Lucinda&rsquo;s eldest son, Bedford, arrived in southern Illinois as a child and continued to live in the Miller Grove community until his death in 1911. Bedford married Abby Gill and they had four daughters. Their graves can be seen in the cemetery among a hundred others, the only lasting element of Miller Grove in today&rsquo;s Shawnee National Forest.</p><p>Other Millers included Andrew Miller and his sister, Matilda, who moved from a Tennessee plantation after being granted freedom from their owner.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p>Cheryl LaRoche, <em>Free Black Communities and the Underground Railroad: the Geography of Resistance</em></p><p>Vickie Devenport and Mary R.

Brewery Creek Guard Station is located 2 miles from Bonanza, a historical silver mining town that was booming in the 1880&#39;s. Today visitors to Bonanza can see old mines, historical buildings, and old time mining equipment as they follow the Bonanza Mines Off-Highway Vehicle Tour (Maps for the Bonanza Off-Highway Vehicle Tour are available at the Saguache Ranger Station). Several hiking trails are also in close proximity to the cabin, including the Elkhorn Trail and several other trails leading up to Antora and Antora Meadows. Elk, deer, and other wildlife are often seen in meadows adjacent to the cabin. Renters are required to pack out all garbage. PACK IT IN, PACK IT OUT. CABIN MUST BE CLEANED BEFORE LEAVING, LEAVE THE CABIN IN THE CONDITION YOU WOULD LIKE TO FIND IT! Visitors to the National Forest are responsible for knowing the rules and regulations of the forest. Travel maps for the Rio Grande National Forest can be obtained by calling the Forest Service Office in Saguache (719)655-2547 or the Forest Supervisor&#39;s Office in Monte Vista (719)852-5941.</p>",

The campground is lightly wooded with spruce trees, creating a beautiful meadow atmosphere.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Rio Grande National Forest spans 1.86 million acres in south-central Colorado. The Continental Divide runs for 236 miles along most of the forest&#39;s western border, presenting a myriad of ecosystems from alpine desert to dense wilderness.</p><p><strong>Natural Features</strong>:</p><p>The campground meanders up a mountainside above Big Meadows Reservoir in a series of 3 loops. As a sub-alpine region, the campground gets more snow melt and rainfall than the opposite side of the lake, resulting in plentiful wildflowers and aspens surrounding the campsites.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:</p><p>An accessible fishing pier, located on the north shore of the reservoir, allows anglers to cast for rainbow, brown and brook trout. Hunting, boating and hiking are also popular pastimes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hikers and horseback riders will enjoy the nearby, 6-mile Archuleta Trail. The trail accesses the Weminuche Wilderness, Colorado&#39;s largest wilderness, which boasts the headwaters of dozens of major streams and rivers that feed into the Rio Grande and San Juan rivers.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>:</p><p>Each site has a campfire ring and picnic tables. Drinking water is available.&nbsp;<br /><br />The nearest dump station is 13 miles away, and a boat ramp is located on the north shore of the reservoir.</p><p>There is a picnic area adjacent to this campground.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions:</strong></p><p>The surrounding area has plenty to keep visitors busy, with attractions like Great Sand Dunes National Park, Native American ruins,&nbsp;the Continental Divide Trail&nbsp;and gold rush ghost towns. The Sangre de Cristo and San Juan Ranges are laced with trails for&nbsp;all levels of &nbsp;hikers.</p><p><strong>Fish Your National Forests:</strong> This site can be accessed by Passen",

The unique landscape was created by extreme erosion and faulting that has sculpted spectacular canyons and buttes. The rim serves as the geographical dividing line between the cool high country above and the hot, dry desert below. Christopher Creek is located in the desert portion, but is balanced by the cool waters of the creek and forested surroundings.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>Christopher Creek provides creek side dwelling in Tonto National Forest, at the base of the Mogollon Rim. Sites are surrounded by ponderosa pines, junipers, oaks and manzanita evergreen shrubs.</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>:&nbsp;After a day of horseback riding or mountain biking, take a dip in one of the facility&#39;s three swimming holes to cool off from the summer sun. Or if winter is more your thing, visit during the snowy months to take advantage of the miles of cross-country skiing available. Each spring, the creek is stocked with rainbow trout, allowing anglers the opportunity to cast their hearts out for rainbows as well as brook and brown trout.</p><p><strong>Facilities</strong>: The family-friendly campground has 43 sites on both sides of the creek, plus a group site that accommodates a maximum of 25 people.</p><p><strong>Nearby Attractions:&nbsp;</strong>The small town of Christopher Creek is just a short drive away and offers a few restaurant options for those who tire of cooking",

Its boundaries are Phoenix to the south, the Mogollon Rim to the north and the San Carlos and Fort Apache Indian reservations to the east.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>The ponderosa pine trees make this a memorable campground. Larger ponderosas release a vanilla scent into the air and have a relatively open understory, making the area perfect for camping. Mixed into the understory are junipers, oaks and manzanita shrubs.&nbsp;The campground sits on the border of the Mogollon Rim, pronounced by locals as &quot;muggy-own,&quot; a 200-mile-long cliff in northern Arizona that ranges between 5,000 and 7,000 feet in elevation. The unique landscape was created by extreme erosion and faulting that has sculpted spectacular canyons and buttes.

A series of lakes called the Rim Country Lakes are about a 15 minute drive east. Woods Canyon Lake is one of the most popular recreational lakes in the state and offers options for boating.</p><p><strong>Facilities:&nbsp;</strong>The facility provides 48 single campsites and two group sites that can accommodate up to 50 people guests ea",

The Verde River flows through this entire district; Horseshoe and Bartlett Reservoirs are located here.</p><p>Watershed protection was one of the most important reasons that the Tonto National Forest was established. Since then, the Salt and Verde rivers have had six dams constructed. While the dammed water is of great value for irrigating fields and for domestic use, it is also very popular with thousands of people who recreate in its waters every year.</p><p>Water recreation ranges from the simple to the sophisticated. Some activities require highly mechanized equipment, while other popular activities only require a swimming suit. Whatever your preferences, the Tonto National Forest has plenty to offer when it comes to water recreation.</p><p>There are also commercial partners who provide a variety of water-based recreation opportunities.</p><p><strong>Contact information: </strong></p><p><strong>Address:</strong> 40202 North Cave Creek Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85262<br /><strong>Phone:</strong> (480) 595-3300<br /><strong>Fax:</strong> (480) 595-3346</p>",

While it lacks the size of the Grand Canyon, it certainly measures up in terms of outstanding, rugged geology and sheer scenic beauty. It is one of a few rivers to flow through the saguaro cactus forests of the Sonoran Desert, a truly exotic landscape.</p><p>A Tonto National Forest Upper Salt River boater permit is required to float the Salt River Canyon Wilderness from March 1st to May 15th annually. The Upper Salt River is a solid Class III-IV river and requires whitewater boating skills. As the water level drops the river becomes more technically difficult, and at low water a few of the rapids approach Class V. Because it is a free flowing river, it also has the potential to go to flood stage and become very dangerous in just hours.</p><p>The weather varies greatly in the Sonoran Desert, and it is not uncommon to find yourself wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and later wearing your winter weather gear. It is a good idea to&nbsp;check the weather&nbsp;before you leave for your trip, as there is no cell phone service in the canyon.&nbsp;Water levels&nbsp;vary from year to year, so it is wise to check on the&nbsp;snow pack&nbsp;in Arizona&#39;s White Mountains.</p><p>You must launch on your permitted day. Typically boaters launch on river right from First Campground on Apache Road 1 just down from where the Highway 60 Bridge crosses the Upper Salt River. The take-out for the permitted wilderness section is just downstream of the Highway 288 Bridge on river left, 52.3 miles downstream from First Campground. Most people with boater permits plan a four or five day river trip.</p><p>There are no trails in the Salt River Canyon Wilderness, but many of the side canyons are great hikes. The wildflowers in the Sonoran Desert can be magical in the spring, and just walking out into the desert from any of the camps can lead to fabulous scenic hiking.</p><p>There are several grocery stores in Globe, the ",

At this time of year the woods, water, flora and fauna are richly picturesque. Campgrounds are in their grandeur and are not crowded. Fishing for salmon and trout is excellent.</p><p>The Hiawatha has over 30 varieties of trees which provide a rainbow of colors. The maple, oak, birch, beech, and aspen provide the reds, golds and yellows. The pines, spruce, hemlock and cedar provide the greens and the lakes provide different hues of blue.</p><p>Hike the many trails or drive the network of roads throughout the forest. Use this guide for your auto tour or pick up additional information on camping and hiking at our area offices listed below. It is a good idea to also pick up a detailed map of the Forest. The map shows towns, points of interest, and picnic and camping areas.</p><p>Please remember that the roads through a forest may be gravel or dirt and may be single or double lane.

A light or set of lights was needed to allow vessels to use Munising Harbor as a major harbor of refuge. The Lighthouse Board spent the funds in 1868-70 building the East Channel Light and a pair of range lights on shore. The lighthouse, a wood framed keeper&#39;s house with an attached square wooden tower operated only until 1913 when it was replaced by the new range lights installed at Munising in 1908. George Prior was working as keeper at the East Channel Light at the turn of the century and was probably the last person to serve at the post.</p><p>The Grand Island East Channel Lighthouse is on the southeast shore of Grand Island. You can see it from the decks of a Pictured Rocks or Alger underwater preserve cruise boat as it heads from Munising Harbor to the national lakeshore area, or from a private boat. Though Grand Island is a designated National Recreation Area and is now much more accessible to the public, <strong>the lighthouse itself remains on private property.</strong></p><p>Long abandoned, the lighthouse was in danger of crumbling to the ground until just a few years ago, when a group of private citizens, including the owner, decided to do something about it. They repaired its stone foundation and supported the tower and house with a series of cables. Now a much sturdier building rests on the sandy shoreline of the island.</p><p>Its deep brown foundation shows signs of the repairs, but its wood siding has not seen a trace of paint or other decoration. The wood has weathered to a dark gray and the square tower is capped with a dome of green copper roofing and exposed to the eleme",

Frank originally came to the Straits area to help build the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island. It was commissioned on May 15, 1896 under the U.S. Lighthouse Board which became the United States Lighthouse Service in 1910. In 1924 the beacon was automated and the United States Coast Guard was given responsibility for all lighthouses in 1939. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1947, and transferred to the United States Forest Service in 1958. The beacon has gone through several changes of lighting technology, from oil to electricity. It originally had a 4th order Fresnel lens with a steady white light followed by a red flash every 20 seconds. Today it is powered by the sun using solar cells and storage batteries. On the first floor, most of the original machinery for operation of the lighthouse and foghorn were removed for scrap to support World War II efforts. The second and third floors provided living quarters for the lighthouse keepers and their families during the shipping season.</p><p>The Forest Service has a unique partnership to assist with maintenance and upkeep of the lighthouse and out buildings.&nbsp; The Round Island Lighthouse Preservation Society is a Michigan non-profit corporation, founded solely to assist with facilitating the preservation of the Round Island Lighthouse and grounds.&nbsp; In addition, the Lake Huron Area Council Boy Scout Troop 323 of Freeland, Michigan also assists with summer clean-up activities and repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about the Round Island Lighthouse, please call the S",

Young men looked to the newly constructed Civilian               Conservation Corps (CCC) as an opportunity to earn money to help               feed their families. In creating the CCC, President Franklin D.               Roosevelt saw it as a way to put such men to work and at the same               time, revitalize the country's ravaged natural resources. It was               natural that much of the CCC work centered on National Forests               like that of the Hiawatha. On the Manistique R. D. (which in 1935               covered 333,000 acres) are a number of CCC sites, including camps,               work projects and plantations.</p>",

The cabin takes visitors back to a rustic, old-time setting and provides access to a variety of recreational opportunities on public lands.&nbsp;The site is available year-round and offers additional camping areas to accommodate large groups. An adjacent well-equipped picnic area provides a convenient location for everyone to gather.&nbsp;The cabin can be accessed by vehicle, however during winter months (October through April), alternative resources may be required to reach the cabin. The road is plowed up to three-quarters of a mile from the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p><p><strong>Natural Features:&nbsp;</strong>The rustic cabin was built before 1914 and was restored in 1987. It was originally a guard station, used by fire watchers in the forest. It is situated on the East Fork of Bitterroot River, at an elevation of about 4,500 feet. &nbsp;The river flows west from within the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness, to just south of Conner, Montana, where it joins the West Fork of the Bitterroot River to form the Bitterroot River. During the spring the river becomes a dangerous combination of fast water and snags.&nbsp;The Anacondas are home to abundant wildlife, including mountain lions, elk, deer, moose and bears (learn about outdoor safety).</p><p><strong>Recreation</strong>: Fishing is popular in the nearby river. A variety of trout, including brown, rainbow, cutthroat and brook, can be found in the area between Sula and Conner. Winter fishing for whitefish is popular and productive, as the river is closed to trout fishing during the colder months. The catch along the East Fork is fairly evenly divided between bait, spin and fly fishermen.&nbsp;The surrounding hills and valleys are popular for hiking, backpacking and horseback riding in the summer and fall.

Camping is primitive, with no facilities such as tables, toilets or drinking water. The diversity of habitats along the road attracts a variety of wildlife, so stop frequently to scan the surrounding area. During the breeding season in spring, watch for nesting bald eagles and listen for loons calling from the water. Walk along the edge of the bay in the spring and fall and scan the adjacent trees and shrubs for migrating songbirds. In the summer, stop for a swim and watch for waterfowl feeding in the shallow bay. This is also an important winter deer range as the browse line on the trees indicates. Trails traverse the area and provide a wonderful experience. Depending on water levels, the boat launch may be used to launch small boats. Kayak &amp; canoe access is available.</p>",

The boat access to Ironjaw Lake (62 acres) is down a steep hill but the surface is firm. Turn-around and back-in space at the base of the hill is very limited however, and 4 wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Parking is restricted to a small area located at the top of the hill. Ironjaw Lake is one of the better fishing lakes in the area. Crappie fishing is excellent in the spring. The lake also contains northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and bullheads.

Nearby recreation opportunities abound, including hunting, fishing, hiking, mountain biking, swimming, skiing and more! The cabin was constructed in 1991 through a partnership between the Forest Service and Hiawatha Log Homes of Munising, as well as through considerable volunteer labor.

The cabin is situated on a small knoll surrounded by young evergreens and hardwood trees, and it is adjacent to McKeever Hills cross-country ski trail and Bruno`s Run hiking trail. Other recreation opportunities in the area include lake fishing, biking, canoeing, swimming and hunting. Developed campgrounds exist at nearby Pete`s Lake and Widewaters Recreation Areas. The Big Island Lake Wilderness, which provides only non-motorized opportunities, is a short distance away as well. McKeever Lake was stocked with northern muskie in 1990.

During the 1860&#39;s, the ports of Escanaba, Gladstone, Fayette and Nahma were teeming with ships hauling fish, lumber, iron ore and other products. These sailing ships needed navigational help to protect their hulls. When iron ore loading docks were built in Escanaba in 1864, Congress appropriated the funds to build a lighthouse. Construction of the lighthouse in 1865, included a 1&frac12; story brick home for the keeper and his family. A hand-operated oil lamp burned in the lighthouse until 1922, when an automated acetylene light replaced it. The lighthouse keeper, Captain James Armstrong was transferred to the Escanaba light station. In 1936, when the Minneapolis shoal lighthouse was put into operation, Peninsula Point light was snuffed out and the property declared surplus. In 1937, the FS was granted custodianship of Peninsula Point Lighthouse. The Civilian Conservation Corps repaired the buildings and constructed picnic grounds. However, the remote unoccupied station became a target for vandals and in 1948, when the FS could no longer finance repairs, demolition of the lighthouse was considered. The Stonington Grange agreed to take over maintenance, and their rehabilitation work earned them first prize in the 1949 statewide Grange Community Service contest. The lighthouse keeper&rsquo;s quarters burned in 1959, but the brick tower survived and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today visitors can climb the 40 foot circular staircase to find a panoramic view of Lake Michigan. Rest rooms, as well as tables and grills for picnics, are available. The limestone shoreline yields fossils estimated at 400-500 million years old. And Peninsula Point is also a popular spot to enjoy the Monarch Butterfly and bird mi",

The lake is 1/4 mile north of County Road 440, off Forest Road 2082. The cabin itself is situated on a small knoll on a large semi-open area surrounded by tall pines. The cabin is one-quarter mile west of the Ironjaw semi-primitive area and the Pine Marten Run trail system, which offers 26 miles of trail suitable for horseback riders, mountain bikers and hikers. The cabin is also within a short commute of the Big Island Lake Wilderness with its 23 small lakes and portages to challenge the canoeist. The nationally-designated Wild and Scenic Indian River is also nearby, and its 51 miles offer outstanding canoeing and fishing opportunities. For the winter enthusiast, snowmobile trails can be found nearby, and the Pine Marten Run trail is frequently used for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing (although the trail is not groomed). There are a wide variety of year-round recreational experiences available in the area! There is a good swimming area at Tom&#39;s Lake, however the site has not been checked for possible hazards so caution should be exercised. Please remember that you swim at your own risk. Boat access to the lake is limited to carry-in only. There are private cabins on the other side of the lake, and you may see or hear motorized boats and jet skis that access Tom&#39;s Lake from their properties.

The Iroquois had invaded the area in an attempt to gain influence and dominate the fur trade, but the Ojibwa were able to defeat the Iroquois war party, thus halting their westward expansion.

The locks have since become the most heavily used commercial shipping canal in the world.</p><p>The first lighthouse and lightkeepers residence were built in 1855, and the light was exhibited for the first time on September 20, 1857.

He used hand-split shakes and log construction to supplement purchased building materials. Because of budget limitations, the Forest Service often relied upon rangers to construct their own stations. Construction details on the Suiattle Guard Station, such as the half-dovetail notching, is a tribute to Ranger Thompson`s craftsmanship. As a testament, the cabin survives to this day as one of the two oldest administrative buildings in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.

The fall months bring cooler temperatures and lower snow levels, limiting hiking access to the high country.
