# Project #2: Visualize Me, Captain!
## Harmony, Robert, Alec -

# Topic

We chose to do a Project on the Forest Service and Recreational Activities.  Within our chosen Data Set we can build a map of listed Forests and activities within each forest area. We can also pull data on forest trails and will be able to build a map based on Latitude and Longitude within the U.S.  We also liked this choice as it is updated often.  

# Inspiration

Our inspiration was that everything is shut down, it is spring, the weather is getting warmer and as we are all quarantined what a perfect time to start planning that perfect outing!!

Part of our inspiration with this data is that this data is kept up to date often, as you can see in the following screenshot just 20 hours ago!

Not only is the data updated often but there are so many additional possibilities we can add. It allows us to pull the CSVs' on the various topics shown in the following screenshot and join them in our own database such as SQL.  Then we could run any number of queries!
